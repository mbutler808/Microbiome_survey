OBJECTIVE: The bacterial intestinal microbiota plays major roles in human 
physiology and IBDs. Although some data suggest a role of the fungal microbiota 
in IBD pathogenesis, the available data are scarce. The aim of our study was to 
characterise the faecal fungal microbiota in patients with IBD.
DESIGN: Bacterial and fungal composition of the faecal microbiota of 235 
patients with IBD and 38 healthy subjects (HS) was determined using 16S and ITS2 
sequencing, respectively. The obtained sequences were analysed using the Qiime 
pipeline to assess composition and diversity. Bacterial and fungal taxa 
associated with clinical parameters were identified using multivariate 
association with linear models. Correlation between bacterial and fungal 
microbiota was investigated using Spearman's test and distance correlation.
RESULTS: We observed that fungal microbiota is skewed in IBD, with an increased 
Basidiomycota/Ascomycota ratio, a decreased proportion of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae and an increased proportion of Candida albicans compared with HS. We 
also identified disease-specific alterations in diversity, indicating that a 
Crohn's disease-specific gut environment may favour fungi at the expense of 
bacteria. The concomitant analysis of bacterial and fungal microbiota showed a 
dense and homogenous correlation network in HS but a dramatically unbalanced 
network in IBD, suggesting the existence of disease-specific inter-kingdom 
alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides bacterial dysbiosis, our study identifies a distinct fungal 
microbiota dysbiosis in IBD characterised by alterations in biodiversity and 
composition. Moreover, we unravel here disease-specific inter-kingdom network 
alterations in IBD, suggesting that, beyond bacteria, fungi might also play a 
role in IBD pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Most studies describing the human gut microbiome in healthy and 
diseased states have emphasized the bacterial component, but the fungal 
microbiome (i.e., the mycobiome) is beginning to gain recognition as a 
fundamental part of our microbiome. To date, human gut mycobiome studies have 
primarily been disease centric or in small cohorts of healthy individuals. To 
contribute to existing knowledge of the human mycobiome, we investigated the gut 
mycobiome of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort by sequencing the 
Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region as well as the 18S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: Three hundred seventeen HMP stool samples were analyzed by ITS2 
sequencing. Fecal fungal diversity was significantly lower in comparison to 
bacterial diversity. Yeast dominated the samples, comprising eight of the top 15 
most abundant genera. Specifically, fungal communities were characterized by a 
high prevalence of Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and Candida, with S. cerevisiae, 
M. restricta, and C. albicans operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in 
96.8, 88.3, and 80.8% of samples, respectively. There was a high degree of 
inter- and intra-volunteer variability in fungal communities. However, S. 
cerevisiae, M. restricta, and C. albicans OTUs were found in 92.2, 78.3, and 
63.6% of volunteers, respectively, in all samples donated over an approximately 
1-year period. Metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data agreed with ITS2 
results; however, ITS2 sequencing provided greater resolution of the relatively 
low abundance mycobiome constituents.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to bacterial communities, the human gut mycobiome is low 
in diversity and dominated by yeast including Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and 
Candida. Both inter- and intra-volunteer variability in the HMP cohort were 
high, revealing that unlike bacterial communities, an individual's mycobiome is 
no more similar to itself over time than to another person's. Nonetheless, 
several fungal species persisted across a majority of samples, evidence that a 
core gut mycobiome may exist. ITS2 sequencing data provided greater resolution 
of the mycobiome membership compared to metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing 
data, suggesting that it is a more sensitive method for studying the mycobiome 
of stool samples.

BACKGROUND: The fungi in the gastrointestinal tract, the gut mycobiota, are now 
recognised as a significant part of the gut microbiota, and they may be 
important to human health. In contrast to the adult gut mycobiota, the 
establishment of the early gut mycobiota has never been described, and there is 
little knowledge about the fungal transfer from mother to offspring.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort, we followed 298 pairs of healthy mothers and 
offspring from 36 weeks of gestation until 2 years of age (1516 samples) and 
explored the gut mycobiota in maternal and offspring samples. Half of the 
pregnant mothers were randomised into drinking probiotic milk during and after 
pregnancy. The probiotic bacteria included Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), 
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. 
We quantified the fungal abundance of all the samples using qPCR of the fungal 
internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 segment, and we sequenced the 18S rRNA gene 
ITS1 region of 90 high-quantity samples using the MiSeq platform (Illumina).
RESULTS: The gut mycobiota was detected in most of the mothers and the majority 
of the offspring. The offspring showed increased odds of having detectable 
faecal fungal DNA if the mother had detectable fungal DNA as well (OR = 1.54, 
p = 0.04). The fungal alpha diversity in the offspring gut increased from its 
lowest at 10 days after birth, which was the earliest sampling point. The fungal 
diversity and fungal species showed a succession towards the maternal mycobiota 
as the child aged, with Debaryomyces hansenii being the most abundant species 
during breast-feeding and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the most abundant after 
weaning. Probiotic consumption increased the gut mycobiota abundance in pregnant 
mothers (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first insight into the early fungal 
establishment and the succession of fungal species in the gut mycobiota. The 
results support the idea that the fungal host phenotype is transferred from 
mother to offspring.

A wide diversity of fungi have been detected in the human gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract with the potential to provide or influence important functions. However, 
many of the fungi most commonly detected in stool samples are also present in 
food or the oral cavity. Therefore, to recognize which gut fungi are likely to 
have a sustained influence on human health, there is a need to separate 
transient members of the GI tract from true colonizers. To identify colonizing 
fungi, the eukaryotic rRNA operon's second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) 
was sequenced from the stool, saliva, and food of healthy adults following 
consumption of different controlled diets. Unlike most bacterial 16S rRNA genes, 
the only fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in stool DNA 
across multiple diets were also present in saliva and/or food. Additional 
analyses, including culture-based approaches and sequencing of the 18S rRNA 
gene, ITS2 cDNA, and DNA extracted using alternative methods, failed to detect 
additional fungi. Two abundant fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida 
albicans, were examined further in healthy volunteers. Saccharomyces became 
undetectable in stool when a S. cerevisiae-free diet was consumed, and the 
levels of C. albicans in stool were dramatically reduced by more frequent 
cleaning of teeth. Extremely low fungal abundance, the inability of fungi to 
grow under conditions mimicking the distal gut, and evidence from analysis of 
other public datasets further support the hypothesis that fungi do not routinely 
colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults. IMPORTANCE We sought to identify the 
fungi that colonize healthy GI tracts and that have a sustained influence on the 
diverse functions of the gut microbiome. Instead, we found that all fungi in the 
stool of healthy volunteers could be explained by their presence in oral and 
dietary sources and that our results, together with those from other analyses, 
support the model that there is little or no gastrointestinal colonization by 
fungi. This may be due to Westernization, primate evolution, fungal ecology, 
and/or the strong defenses of a healthy immune system. Importantly, fungal 
colonization of the GI tract may often be indicative of disease. As fungi can 
cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals and are found at 
increased abundance in multiple disorders of the GI tract, understanding normal 
fungal colonization is essential for proper treatment and prevention of fungal 
pathogenesis.

Understanding the composition and clinical importance of the fungal mycobiome 
was recently identified as a key topic in a "research priorities" consensus 
statement for bronchiectasis.Patients were recruited as part of the CAMEB study: 
an international multicentre cross-sectional Cohort of Asian and Matched 
European Bronchiectasis patients. The mycobiome was determined in 238 patients 
by targeted amplicon shotgun sequencing of the 18S-28S rRNA internally 
transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2. Specific quantitative PCR for 
detection of and conidial quantification for a range of airway Aspergillus 
species was performed. Sputum galactomannan, Aspergillus specific IgE, IgG and 
TARC (thymus and activation regulated chemokine) levels were measured 
systemically and associated to clinical outcomes.The bronchiectasis mycobiome is 
distinct and characterised by specific fungal genera, including Aspergillus, 
Cryptococcus and ClavisporaAspergillus fumigatus (in Singapore/Kuala Lumpur) and 
Aspergillus terreus (in Dundee) dominated profiles, the latter associating with 
exacerbations. High frequencies of Aspergillus-associated disease including 
sensitisation and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were detected. Each 
revealed distinct mycobiome profiles, and associated with more severe disease, 
poorer pulmonary function and increased exacerbations.The pulmonary mycobiome is 
of clinical relevance in bronchiectasis. Screening for Aspergillus-associated 
disease should be considered even in apparently stable patients.

Interest in the human microbiome has increased dramatically in the last decade. 
However, much of this research has focused on bacteria, while the composition 
and roles of their fungal counterparts remain less understood. Furthermore, a 
variety of methodological approaches have been applied, and the comparability 
between studies is unclear. This study compared four primer pairs targeting the 
small subunit (SSU) rRNA (18S), ITS1, ITS2, and large subunit (LSU) rRNA (26S) 
genomic regions for their ability to accurately characterize fungal communities 
typical of the human mycobiota. All four target regions of 21 individual fungal 
mock community taxa were capable of being amplified adequately and sequenced. 
Mixed mock community analyses revealed marked variability in the ability of each 
primer pair to accurately characterize a complex community. ITS target regions 
outperformed LSU and SSU. Of the ITS regions, ITS1 failed to generate sequences 
for Yarrowia lipolytica and all three Malassezia species when in a mixed 
community. These findings were further supported in studies of human sinonasal 
and mouse fecal samples. Based on these analyses, previous studies using ITS1, 
SSU, or LSU markers may omit key taxa that are identified by the ITS2 marker. Of 
methods commonly used in human mycobiota studies to date, we recommend selection 
of the ITS2 marker. Further investigation of more recently developed fungal 
primer options will be essential to ultimately determine the optimal 
methodological approach by which future human mycobiota studies ought to be 
standardized.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases 
(IBD). In colorectal cancer, the gut microbiota has also been recognized as 
potentially involved in aggravating or favoring the tumor development. However, 
very little is known on the structure and role of the microbiota in colitis 
associated cancer (CAC), an important complication of IBD in human. Here we 
analyzed the bacterial and fungal composition of the mucosa associated 
microbiota of patients suffering CAC, sporadic cancer (SC) and of healthy 
subjects (HS) by barcode sequences analysis on the following cohort: 7 CAC 
patients, 10 SC patients and 10 HS using 16S (MiSeq) and ITS2 (pyrosequencing) 
sequencing, for bacteria and fungi respectively. Mucosa-associated bacterial 
microbiota in CAC was significantly different from the ones in SC or in HS, 
while the fungal showed no differences. Comparison between mucosa-associated 
microbiota on the tumor site or in normal mucosa near the tumor showed very 
similar patterns. The global mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in cancer 
patients was characterized by a restriction in biodiversity but no change for 
the fungal community. Compared to SC, CAC was characterized by an increase of 
Enterobacteriacae family and Sphingomonas genus and a decrease of Fusobacterium 
and Ruminococcus genus. Our study confirms the alteration of the 
mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in IBD and SC. Although the cohort is 
limited in number, this is the first evidence of the existence of an altered 
bacterial microbiota in CAC clearly different from the one in SC patients.

The microbiome is important to all animals, including poultry, playing a 
critical role in health and performance. Low-dose antibiotics have historically 
been used to modulate food production animals and their microbiome. Identifying 
alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar modulatory properties has been 
elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if a host-tailored probiotic 
could recapitulate effects of a low-dose antibiotic on host response and the 
developing microbiome. Over 13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented 
continuously with a low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic 
with or without two different probiotics (8 cage units, n = 80 per group). 
Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were characterized 
by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized and systemic host gene 
expression was assessed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase 
activity was assessed by avian-specific kinome peptide arrays, and performance 
parameters were assessed. We found that development of the early-life microbiome 
of turkey poults was tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. 
Low-dose antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not 
nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in overall 
microbiome composition during development compared to controls. 
Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts in the 
fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced performance metrics. 
These results were validated in pen trials that identified further additive 
effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic combined with different prebiotics. 
Alternative approaches to low-dose antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and 
can be optimized utilizing the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches 
may also be beneficial for humans.IMPORTANCE Alternative approaches are greatly 
needed to reduce the need for antibiotic use in food animal production. This 
study utilized a pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to 
enhance performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their microbiota, similar 
to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that a 
host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial turkey gut 
microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters than a nontailored 
probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored probiotic mimicked many of 
the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth promoter. Surprisingly, the effects 
of the antibiotic growth promoter and host-tailored probiotic were observed 
across kingdoms, illustrating the coordinated interkingdom effects of these 
approaches. This work suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development 
hold promise for modulating the avian host and its microbiota.

BACKGROUND: The human intestinal microbiota contains a vast community of 
microorganisms increasingly studied using high-throughput DNA sequencing. 
Standardized protocols for storage and DNA extraction from fecal samples have 
been established mostly for bacterial microbiota analysis. Here, we investigated 
the impact of storage and DNA extraction on bacterial and fungal community 
structures detected concomitantly.
METHODS: Fecal samples from healthy adults were stored at -80°C as such or 
diluted in RNAlater® and subjected to 2 extraction protocols with mechanical 
lysis: the Powersoil® MoBio kit or the International Human Microbiota Standard 
(IHMS) Protocol Q. Libraries of the 12 samples targeting the V3-V4 16S and the 
ITS1 regions were prepared using Metabiote® (Genoscreen) and sequenced on 
GS-FLX-454. Sequencing data were analysed using SHAMAN 
(http://shaman.pasteur.fr/). The bacterial and fungal microbiota were compared 
in terms of diversity and relative abundance.
RESULTS: We obtained 171869 and 199089 quality-controlled reads for 16S and ITS, 
respectively. All 16S reads were assigned to 41 bacterial genera; only 52% of 
ITS reads were assigned to 40 fungal genera/section. Rarefaction curves were 
satisfactory in 3/3 and 2/3 subjects for 16S and ITS, respectively. PCoA showed 
important inter-individual variability of intestinal microbiota largely 
overweighing the effect of storage or extraction. Storage in RNAlater® impacted 
(downward trend) the relative abundances of 7/41 bacterial and 6/40 fungal taxa, 
while extraction impacted randomly 18/41 bacterial taxa and 1/40 fungal taxon.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that RNAlater® moderately impacts bacterial or 
fungal community structures, while extraction significantly influences the 
bacterial composition. For combined bacterial and fungal intestinal microbiota 
analysis, immediate sample freezing should be preferred when feasible, but 
storage in RNAlater® remains an option under unfavourable conditions or for 
concomitant metatranscriptomic analysis; and extraction should rely on protocols 
validated for bacterial analysis, such as IHMS Protocol Q, and including a 
powerful mechanical lysis, essential for fungal extraction.

INTRODUCTION: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are responsible for one-third of all 
cancers caused by infections. Most HPV studies focus on chronic infections and 
cancers, and we know little about the early stages of the infection. Our main 
objective is to better understand the course and natural history of cervical HPV 
infections in healthy, unvaccinated and vaccinated, young women, by 
characterising the dynamics of various infection-related populations (virus, 
epithelial cells, vaginal microbiota and immune effectors). Another objective is 
to analyse HPV diversity within hosts, and in the study population, in relation 
to co-factors (lifestyle characteristics, vaccination status, vaginal 
microbiota, human genetics).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The PAPCLEAR study is a single center longitudinal study 
following 150 women, aged 18-25 years, for up to 2 years. Visits occur every 2 
or 4 months (depending on HPV status) during which several variables are 
measured, such as behaviours (via questionnaires), vaginal pH, HPV presence and 
viral load (via qPCR), local concentrations of cytokines (via MesoScale 
Discovery technology) and immune cells (via flow cytometry). Additional analyses 
are outsourced, such as titration of circulating anti-HPV antibodies, vaginal 
microbiota sequencing (16S and ITS1 loci) and human genotyping. To increase the 
statistical power of the epidemiological arm of the study, an additional 150 
women are screened cross-sectionally. Finally, to maximise the resolution of the 
time series, participants are asked to perform weekly self-samples at home. 
Statistical analyses will involve classical tools in epidemiology, genomics and 
virus kinetics, and will be performed or coordinated by the Centre National de 
la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Montpellier.
