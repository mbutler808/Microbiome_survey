BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or 
phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). Differences in the abundances of specific 
bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients. It is, however, unknown 
whether these differences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for 
example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal 
condition of α-synuclein aggregation disorders including PD.
OBJECTIVES: To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and stool 
samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, 
manifest PD, and healthy individuals.
METHODS: Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76 PD 
patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 
78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA amplicon 
sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics, clinical parameters 
including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were analyzed in relation to 
microbiome variability and controlled differential analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia, were 
observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of 
the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls showed similar 
trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, for example, 
Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with nonmotor 
symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select samples enabled the reconstruction of 
genomes of so far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial taxa in 
PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in 
comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the potential of metagenomics 
to identify and characterize microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in 
PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. © 2017 The

Our understanding of the spatial variation in the chemical and microbial makeup 
of an entire human organ remains limited, in part due to the size and 
heterogeneity of human organs and the complexity of the associated metabolome 
and microbiome. To address this challenge, we developed a workflow to enable the 
cartography of metabolomic and microbiome data onto a three-dimensional (3D) 
organ reconstruction built off radiological images. This enabled the direct 
visualization of the microbial and chemical makeup of a human lung from a cystic 
fibrosis patient. We detected host-derived molecules, microbial metabolites, 
medications, and region-specific metabolism of medications and placed it in the 
context of microbial distributions in the lung. Our tool further created 
browsable maps of a 3D microbiome/metabolome reconstruction map on a 
radiological image of a human lung and forms an interactive resource for the 
scientific community.

IMPORTANCE: Although the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) remains 
enigmatic, several factors point to potential involvement of the cutaneous 
microbiome. Insight into the cutaneous microbiome in HS using next-generation 
sequencing may provide novel data on the microbiological diversity of the skin.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the follicular skin microbiome in patients with HS and 
in healthy controls.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study obtained punch biopsy 
specimens from patients with HS (lesional and nonlesional) and healthy controls 
between October 1, 2014, and August 1, 2016. Data were analyzed from March to 
November 2016. Patients with HS were recruited from the Department of 
Dermatology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark. Biopsy specimens 
were analyzed at the Department of Microbiology and Infection Control, Statens 
Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. None of the participants received any 
antibiotics (systemic or topical therapy) within 1 month before the study. In 
patients with HS, biopsy specimens were obtained from lesional skin (axilla or 
groin) and nonlesional skin. Only nodules containing at least 1 visible hair 
follicle were biopsied. Biopsy specimens from healthy controls were obtained 
from the axilla only.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The different microbiomes were investigated using 
next-generation sequencing targeting 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA.
RESULTS: The skin microbiome was characterized in 30 patients with HS (mean [SD] 
age, 46.9 [14.0] years; 19 [63% female]) and 24 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 
32.2 [12.0] years; 13 [54% female]). The next-generation sequencing data 
provided a previously unreported (to our knowledge) characterization of the skin 
microbiome in HS. The study demonstrated that the microbiome in HS differs 
significantly from that in healthy controls in lesional and nonlesional skin. 
Overall, the following 5 microbiome types were identified: Corynebacterium 
species (type I), Acinetobacter and Moraxella species (type II), Staphylococcus 
epidermidis (type III), Porphyromonas and Peptoniphilus species (type IV), and 
Propionibacterium acnes (type V). In lesional skin, microbiome types consisted 
predominantly of type I or type IV. Microbiome type IV was not detected in 
healthy controls. Several taxa, including Propionibacterium, showed a 
significantly higher relative abundance in healthy controls vs HS skin, 
indicating that Propionibacterium may be part of the pathogenesis in HS.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study findings suggest a link between a dysbiotic 
cutaneous microbiome and HS.

BACKGROUND: The esophageal microbiome has been proposed to be involved in a 
range of diseases including the esophageal adenocarcinoma cascade; however, 
little is currently known about its function and relationship to the host. Here, 
the esophageal microbiomes of 106 prospectively recruited patients were assessed 
using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as shotgun sequencing, 
and associations with age, gender, proton pump inhibitor use, host genetics, and 
disease were tested.
RESULTS: The esophageal microbiome was found to cluster into functionally 
distinct community types (esotypes) defined by the relative abundances of 
Streptococcus and Prevotella. While age was found to be a significant factor 
driving microbiome composition, bacterial signatures and functions such as 
enrichment with Gram-negative oral-associated bacteria and microbial lactic acid 
production were associated with the early stages of the esophageal 
adenocarcinoma cascade. Non-bacterial microbes such as archaea, Candida spp., 
and bacteriophages were also identified in low abundance in the esophageal 
microbiome. Specific host SNPs in NOTCH2, STEAP2-AS1, and NREP were associated 
with the composition of the esophageal microbiome in our cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most comprehensive assessment of the 
esophageal microbiome to date and identifies novel signatures and host markers 
that can be investigated further in the context of esophageal adenocarcinoma 
development.

BACKGROUND: Most studies describing the human gut microbiome in healthy and 
diseased states have emphasized the bacterial component, but the fungal 
microbiome (i.e., the mycobiome) is beginning to gain recognition as a 
fundamental part of our microbiome. To date, human gut mycobiome studies have 
primarily been disease centric or in small cohorts of healthy individuals. To 
contribute to existing knowledge of the human mycobiome, we investigated the gut 
mycobiome of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort by sequencing the 
Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region as well as the 18S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: Three hundred seventeen HMP stool samples were analyzed by ITS2 
sequencing. Fecal fungal diversity was significantly lower in comparison to 
bacterial diversity. Yeast dominated the samples, comprising eight of the top 15 
most abundant genera. Specifically, fungal communities were characterized by a 
high prevalence of Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and Candida, with S. cerevisiae, 
M. restricta, and C. albicans operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in 
96.8, 88.3, and 80.8% of samples, respectively. There was a high degree of 
inter- and intra-volunteer variability in fungal communities. However, S. 
cerevisiae, M. restricta, and C. albicans OTUs were found in 92.2, 78.3, and 
63.6% of volunteers, respectively, in all samples donated over an approximately 
1-year period. Metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data agreed with ITS2 
results; however, ITS2 sequencing provided greater resolution of the relatively 
low abundance mycobiome constituents.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to bacterial communities, the human gut mycobiome is low 
in diversity and dominated by yeast including Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and 
Candida. Both inter- and intra-volunteer variability in the HMP cohort were 
high, revealing that unlike bacterial communities, an individual's mycobiome is 
no more similar to itself over time than to another person's. Nonetheless, 
several fungal species persisted across a majority of samples, evidence that a 
core gut mycobiome may exist. ITS2 sequencing data provided greater resolution 
of the mycobiome membership compared to metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing 
data, suggesting that it is a more sensitive method for studying the mycobiome 
of stool samples.

Objectives: A microbiotic profile characterized by decreased abundance and 
richness has been described in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recently, 
sequencing the microbiome to the species level has become possible, which can 
improve our understanding of the gut to host interaction in IBD. We aimed to 
describe the microbiotic profile in paediatric IBD and compare it to disease 
phenotype and disease course. Methods: Faecal samples were collected from a 
cross-sectional cohort. The microbiome analysis was performed using 16S and 18S 
rRNA sequencing with the miSeq instrument. Inflammatory activity was assessed by 
faecal calprotectin. Data regarding medical treatment and surgery in the year 
after faecal sampling were collected from patient charts. Results: One hundred 
and forty-three (143) paediatric IBD patients and 34 healthy controls (HC) were 
included. We found a reduced richness in IBD patients compared to HCs (controls 
vs. ulcerative colitis (UC), p < .001 and controls vs. Crohn's disease (CD), 
p = .04)). Moreover, a high degree of intestinal inflammation and extensive 
disease extent was associated with reduced richness in UC (p = .02 and p = .04, 
respectively). Nine species were significantly associated with a healthy 
microbiome and three species were associated with IBD. Lastly, we found that the 
composition of the microbiome could distinguish between CD, UC and HCs. 
Conclusions: In this study, we found that the microbiome could discriminate 
between IBD phenotypes and predict which patients were at risk of surgery. In 
the future, this could be included as part of the diagnostic work-up in IBD 
patients.

Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization, 
is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted by >140 
triatomine species across the Americas. In Central America, the main vector is 
Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic blood meal feeder inhabiting both domestic 
and sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents 
involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information 
on the dynamics of the parasite, vector, the gut microbiome of the vector, and 
the blood meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated 
with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a 
RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from T. 
dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial 
scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual 
villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. 
Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools 
and used to evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant 
Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of 
T. dimidiata, gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 
3.25 million reads per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1% assigned to 
the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood 
meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors 
harboring two distinct DTUs: TcI and a second unidentified strain, possibly 
TcIV. Vector specimens were sufficiently variable for population genomic 
analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were 
sufficient to detect geographic genetic structure at both local and regional 
scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher 
bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those that 
were not infected. Unifrac analysis suggests a common assemblage of bacteria 
associated with infection, which co-occurs with the typical gut microbial 
community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood 
meals from five T. dimidiata abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck and human; 
however, additional detection methods would be necessary to confidently identify 
blood meal sources from most specimens. Overall, our study shows this method is 
effective for simultaneously generating genetic data on vectors and their 
associated parasites, along with ecological information on feeding patterns and 
microbial interactions that may be followed up with complementary approaches 
such as PCR-based parasite detection, 18S eukaryotic and 16S bacterial 
barcoding.

BACKGROUND: The microbial populations of the human intestinal tract and their 
relationship to specific diseases have been extensively studied during the last 
decade. However, the characterization of the human bile microbiota as a whole 
has been hampered by difficulties in accessing biological samples and the lack 
of adequate methodologies to assess molecular studies. Although a few reports 
have described the biliary microbiota in some hepatobiliary diseases, the bile 
microbiota of healthy individuals has not been described. With this in mind, the 
goal of the present study was to generate fundamental knowledge on the 
composition and activity of the human bile microbiota, as well as establishing 
its potential relationship with human bile-related disorders.
RESULTS: Human bile samples from the gallbladder of individuals from a control 
group, without any record of hepatobiliary disorder, were obtained from liver 
donors during liver transplantation surgery. A bile DNA extraction method was 
optimized together with a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for determining the 
bacterial load. This allows the selection of samples to perform functional 
metagenomic analysis. Bile samples from the gallbladder of individuals suffering 
from lithiasis were collected during gallbladder resection and the microbial 
profiles assessed, using a 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing analysis, and compared 
with those of the control group. Additionally, the metabolic profile of the 
samples was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We detected, for the 
first time, bacterial communities in gallbladder samples of individuals without 
any hepatobiliary pathology. In the biliary microecosystem, the main bacterial 
phyla were represented by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and 
Proteobacteria. Significant differences in the relative abundance of different 
taxa of both groups were found. Sequences belonging to the family 
Propionibacteriaceae were more abundant in bile samples from control subjects; 
meanwhile, in patients with cholelithiasis members of the families 
Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Veillonellaceae were 
more frequently detected. Furthermore, the metabolomics analysis showed that the 
two study groups have different metabolic profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the gallbladder of human individuals, 
without diagnosed hepatobiliary pathology, harbors a microbial ecosystem that is 
described for the first time in this study. Its bacterial representatives and 
metabolites are different from those detected in people suffering from 
cholelithiasis. In this regard, since liver donors have been subjected to the

open up new possibilities to discover bacterial functions in a microbial 
ecosystem that has not previously been explored.

BACKGROUND: The fungi in the gastrointestinal tract, the gut mycobiota, are now 
recognised as a significant part of the gut microbiota, and they may be 
important to human health. In contrast to the adult gut mycobiota, the 
establishment of the early gut mycobiota has never been described, and there is 
little knowledge about the fungal transfer from mother to offspring.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort, we followed 298 pairs of healthy mothers and 
offspring from 36 weeks of gestation until 2 years of age (1516 samples) and 
explored the gut mycobiota in maternal and offspring samples. Half of the 
pregnant mothers were randomised into drinking probiotic milk during and after 
pregnancy. The probiotic bacteria included Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), 
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. 
We quantified the fungal abundance of all the samples using qPCR of the fungal 
internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 segment, and we sequenced the 18S rRNA gene 
ITS1 region of 90 high-quantity samples using the MiSeq platform (Illumina).
RESULTS: The gut mycobiota was detected in most of the mothers and the majority 
of the offspring. The offspring showed increased odds of having detectable 
faecal fungal DNA if the mother had detectable fungal DNA as well (OR = 1.54, 
p = 0.04). The fungal alpha diversity in the offspring gut increased from its 
lowest at 10 days after birth, which was the earliest sampling point. The fungal 
diversity and fungal species showed a succession towards the maternal mycobiota 
as the child aged, with Debaryomyces hansenii being the most abundant species 
during breast-feeding and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the most abundant after 
weaning. Probiotic consumption increased the gut mycobiota abundance in pregnant 
mothers (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first insight into the early fungal 
establishment and the succession of fungal species in the gut mycobiota. The 
results support the idea that the fungal host phenotype is transferred from 
mother to offspring.

Natural plant microbiomes are abundant and have a remarkably robust composition, 
both as epiphytes on the plant surface and as endophytes within plant tissues. 
Microbes in the former "habitat" face limited nutrients and harsh environmental 
conditions, while those in the latter likely lead a more sheltered existence. 
The most populous and diverse of these microbiomes are associated with the zone 
around the plant roots, commonly referred to as the rhizosphere. A majority of 
recent studies characterize these plant-associated microbiomes by community 
profiling of bacteria and fungi, using amplicon-based marker genes and 
next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we collate a group of protocols that 
incorporate current best practices and optimized methodologies for sampling, 
handling of samples, and rRNA library preparation for variable regions of V5-V6 
and V9 of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, and the ITS2 region 
joining the 5.8S and 28S regions of the fungal rRNA gene. Samples collected for 
such culture-independent analyses can also be used for the actual isolation of 
microbes of interest, perhaps even those identified by the libraries described 
above. One group of microbes that holds promise for mediating plant stress 
incurred by drought are bacteria that are capable of reducing or eliminating the 
plant's perception of the stress through degradation of the gaseous plant 
hormone ethylene, which is abundantly produced in response to drought stimuli. 
This is accomplished by some types of soil bacteria that can produce the enzyme 
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which is the immediate 
precursor to ethylene. Here we provide a high-throughput protocol for screening 
of ACC deaminase-producing bacteria for the applied purpose of mitigating the 
impact of plant drought stress.

Ballast water is a vector for global translocation of microorganisms, and should 
be monitored to protect human and environmental health. This study utilizes high 
throughput sequencing (HTS) and machine learning to examine the bacterial and 
fungal microbiomes of ballast water to identify associations between 16S and 18S 
rRNA genes and the fungal ITS region. These sequencing regions were examined 
using the SILVA v132 and UNITE reference databases. The highest correlation was 
found between the communities in Silva_16S and UNITE_ITS (0.74). There was a 
higher proportion of positive inter-kingdom correlations than positive 
intra-kingdom interactions (p = 0.032). Understanding the reasons for this 
difference requires additional research under more controlled conditions. 
Finally, a machine learning model was used to examine the classification 
accuracy when using each sequencing region and reference database to identify 
ballast residence time and ballast sample location. There was significantly 
higher accuracy using SILVA (0.843) compared to UNITE (0.614) (p < 0.001). In 
the short term, future research with the goal of classifying ballast water 
samples based on location or ballast water residence time should be performed 
using the 16S rRNA gene and SILVA reference database. Research to curate other 
sequencing regions or the UNITE reference database in the aquatic ecosystem may 
improve the utility of these tools.

A wide diversity of fungi have been detected in the human gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract with the potential to provide or influence important functions. However, 
many of the fungi most commonly detected in stool samples are also present in 
food or the oral cavity. Therefore, to recognize which gut fungi are likely to 
have a sustained influence on human health, there is a need to separate 
transient members of the GI tract from true colonizers. To identify colonizing 
fungi, the eukaryotic rRNA operon's second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) 
was sequenced from the stool, saliva, and food of healthy adults following 
consumption of different controlled diets. Unlike most bacterial 16S rRNA genes, 
the only fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in stool DNA 
across multiple diets were also present in saliva and/or food. Additional 
analyses, including culture-based approaches and sequencing of the 18S rRNA 
gene, ITS2 cDNA, and DNA extracted using alternative methods, failed to detect 
additional fungi. Two abundant fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida 
albicans, were examined further in healthy volunteers. Saccharomyces became 
undetectable in stool when a S. cerevisiae-free diet was consumed, and the 
levels of C. albicans in stool were dramatically reduced by more frequent 
cleaning of teeth. Extremely low fungal abundance, the inability of fungi to 
grow under conditions mimicking the distal gut, and evidence from analysis of 
other public datasets further support the hypothesis that fungi do not routinely 
colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults. IMPORTANCE We sought to identify the 
fungi that colonize healthy GI tracts and that have a sustained influence on the 
diverse functions of the gut microbiome. Instead, we found that all fungi in the 
stool of healthy volunteers could be explained by their presence in oral and 
dietary sources and that our results, together with those from other analyses, 
support the model that there is little or no gastrointestinal colonization by 
fungi. This may be due to Westernization, primate evolution, fungal ecology, 
and/or the strong defenses of a healthy immune system. Importantly, fungal 
colonization of the GI tract may often be indicative of disease. As fungi can 
cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals and are found at 
increased abundance in multiple disorders of the GI tract, understanding normal 
fungal colonization is essential for proper treatment and prevention of fungal 
pathogenesis.

The microbiome and associated metabolome of faecal samples were compared to 
those from the caecum and right dorsal colon of horses and ponies euthanised for 
nonresearch purposes by investigating the microbial population community 
structure as well as their functional metabolic products. Through the use of 16S 
rRNA gene dendrograms, the caecum microbiome was shown to cluster separately 
from the other gut regions. 16S rRNA gene-based quantitative PCR (q-PCR) also 
demonstrated differences between the caecum and the other gut regions. 
Metabolites as identified by Fourier transform infrared clustered in a similar 
way and specific metabolic products (volatile fatty acids and ammonia) also 
varied by region. Protozoal 18S rDNA concentration and archaeal mcrA gene 
concentration quantified by q-PCR were found in higher numbers in the colon than 
the other gut regions. Diversity calculations using Simpson and Shannon-Wiener 
indices demonstrated higher diversity in the right dorsal colon and faeces than 
in the caecum. All findings of this study suggest that faecal samples are likely 
to represent the microbial population of the right dorsal colon to some extent 
but not that of the caecum, indicating careful consideration is required when 
planning microbial investigations of the hindgut of the horse.

Understanding the composition and clinical importance of the fungal mycobiome 
was recently identified as a key topic in a "research priorities" consensus 
statement for bronchiectasis.Patients were recruited as part of the CAMEB study: 
an international multicentre cross-sectional Cohort of Asian and Matched 
European Bronchiectasis patients. The mycobiome was determined in 238 patients 
by targeted amplicon shotgun sequencing of the 18S-28S rRNA internally 
transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2. Specific quantitative PCR for 
detection of and conidial quantification for a range of airway Aspergillus 
species was performed. Sputum galactomannan, Aspergillus specific IgE, IgG and 
TARC (thymus and activation regulated chemokine) levels were measured 
systemically and associated to clinical outcomes.The bronchiectasis mycobiome is 
distinct and characterised by specific fungal genera, including Aspergillus, 
Cryptococcus and ClavisporaAspergillus fumigatus (in Singapore/Kuala Lumpur) and 
Aspergillus terreus (in Dundee) dominated profiles, the latter associating with 
exacerbations. High frequencies of Aspergillus-associated disease including 
sensitisation and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were detected. Each 
revealed distinct mycobiome profiles, and associated with more severe disease, 
poorer pulmonary function and increased exacerbations.The pulmonary mycobiome is 
of clinical relevance in bronchiectasis. Screening for Aspergillus-associated 
disease should be considered even in apparently stable patients.

Interactions with microorganisms might enable house dust mites (HDMs) to derive 
nutrients from difficult-to-digest structural proteins and to flourish in human 
houses. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effects of changes in the 
mite culture growth and population of two HDM species on HDM microbiome 
composition and fitness. Growing cultures of laboratory and industrial 
allergen-producing populations of Dermatophagoides farinae (DFL and DFT, 
respectively) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DPL and DPT, respectively) 
were sampled at four time points. The symbiotic microorganisms of the mites were 
characterized by DNA barcode sequencing and quantified by qPCR using 
universal/specific primers. The population growth of mites and nutrient contents 
of mite bodies were measured and correlated with the changes in bacteria in the 
HDM microbiome. The results showed that both the population and culture age 
significantly influenced the microbiome profiles. Cardinium formed 93% and 32% 
of the total sequences of the DFL and DFT bacterial microbiomes, respectively, 
but this bacterial species was less abundant in the DPL and DPT microbiomes. 
Staphylococcus abundance was positively correlated with increased glycogen 
contents in the bodies of mites, and increased abundances of Aspergillus, 
Candida, and Kocuria were correlated with increased lipid contents in the bodies 
of mites. The xerophilic fungus Wallemia accounted for 39% of the fungal 
sequences in the DPL microbiome, but its abundance was low in the DPT, DFL, and 
DFT microbiomes. With respect to the mite culture age, we made three important 
observations: the mite population growth from young cultures was 5-8-fold higher 
than that from old cultures; specimens from old cultures had greater abundances 
of fungi and bacteria in their bodies; and yeasts predominated in the gut 
contents of specimens from young cultures, whereas filamentous mycelium 
prevailed in specimens from old cultures. Our results are consistent with the 
hypothesis that mites derive nutrients through associations with microorganisms.

OBJECTIVE: Human gut microbiome studies are mainly bacteria- and 
archaea-oriented, overlooking the presence of single-cell eukaryotes such as 
Blastocystis, an enteric stramenopiles with worldwide distribution. Here, we 
surveyed the prevalence and subtype variation of Blastocystis in faecal samples 
collected as part of the Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP), a Western population 
cohort. We assessed potential links between Blastocystis subtypes and identified 
microbiota-host covariates and quantified microbiota differentiation relative to 
subtype abundances.
DESIGN: We profiled stool samples from 616 healthy individuals from the FGFP 
cohort as well as 107 patients with IBD using amplicon sequencing targeting the 
V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. We evaluated associations 
of Blastocystis, and their subtypes, with host parameters, diversity and 
composition of bacterial and archaeal communities.
RESULTS: Blastocystis prevalence in the non-clinical population cohort was 30% 
compared with 4% among Flemish patients with IBD. Within the FGFP cohort, out of 
69 previously identified gut microbiota covariates, only age was associated with 
Blastocystis subtype carrier status. In contrast, a strong association between 
microbiota community composition and Blastocystis subtypes was observed, with 
effect sizes larger than that of host covariates. Microbial richness and 
diversity were linked to both Blastocystis prevalence and subtype variation. All 
Blastocystis subtypes detected in this cohort were found to be less prevalent in 
Bacteroides enterotyped samples. Interestingly, Blastocystis subtypes 3 and 4 
were inversely correlated with Akkermansia, suggesting differential associations 
of subtypes with host health.
CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasise the role of Blastocystis as a common 
constituent of the healthy gut microbiota. We show its prevalence is reduced in 
patients with active IBD and demonstrate that subtype characterisation is 
essential for assessing the relationship between Blastocystis, microbiota 
profile and host health. These findings have direct clinical applications, 
especially in donor selection for faecal transplantation.

With the advent of low-cost, high-throughput sequencing, taxonomic profiling of 
complex microbial communities through 16S rRNA marker gene surveys has received 
widespread interest, uncovering a wealth of information concerning the bacterial 
composition of microbial communities, as well as their association with health 
and disease. On the other hand, little is known concerning the eukaryotic 
components of microbiomes. Such components include single-celled parasites and 
multicellular worms that are known to adversely impact the health of millions of 
people worldwide. Current molecular methods to detect eukaryotic microbes rely 
on the use of directed PCR analyses that are limited by their inability to 
inform beyond the taxon targeted. With increasing interest to develop equivalent 
marker-based surveys as used for bacteria, this chapter presents a stepwise 
protocol to characterize the diversity of eukaryotic microbes in a sample, using 
amplicon sequencing of hypervariable regions in the eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene.

Pediculosis is a disease caused by the insect Pediculus humanus capitis that 
mainly occurs in childhood. A comparative study was carried out evaluating 
groups of schoolchildren with (group A) and without pediculosis (group B) to 
analyse the characteristics of the scalp microbiota. Samples were collected by 
swab using Stuart transport medium and incubate in Sabouraud dextrose agar with 
tetracycline to analyse the fungal microbiota and in blood agar to assess the 
bacterial microbiota. The isolates identity was confirmed by sequencing of the 
16S and 18S regions of the ribosomal DNA gene for bacteria and fungi, 
respectively. The analysis of the 186 isolates led to the identification of 35 
bacteria and 40 fungi in group A and 47 bacteria and 64 fungi in group B. The 
results indicate differences in bacterial and fungal species in the groups 
analysed. In the observed bacterial microbiota, Staphylococcus capitis occurred 
more frequently than Staphylococcus epidermidis in group A vs B. Among fungal

Environmental microbes have been associated with both protective and adverse 
health effects in children and adults. Epidemiological studies often rely on 
broad biomarkers of microbial exposure (i.e. endotoxin, 1 → 3-beta-d-glucan), 
but fail to identify the taxonomic composition of the microbial community. Our 
aim was to characterize the bacterial and fungal microbiome in different types 
of environmental samples collected in studies of human health effects. We 
determined the composition of microbial communities present in home, school and 
outdoor air samples by amplifying and sequencing regions of rRNA genes from 
bacteria (16S) and fungi (18S and ITS). Samples for this pilot study included 
indoor settled dust (from both a Boston area birth cohort study on Home 
Allergens and Asthma (HAA) (n = 12) and a study of school exposures and asthma 
symptoms (SICAS) (n = 1)), as well as fine and coarse concentrated outdoor 
ambient particulate (CAP) samples (n = 9). Sequencing of amplified 16S, 18S, and 
ITS regions was performed on the Roche-454 Life Sciences Titanium pyrosequencing 
platform. Indoor dust samples were dominated by Gram-positive bacteria 
(Firmicutes and Actinobacteria); the most abundant bacterial genera were those 
related to human flora (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and 
Lactobacillus). Outdoor CAPs were dominated by Gram-negative Proteobacteria from 
water and soil sources, in particular the genera Acidovorax, and Brevundimonas 
(which were present at very low levels or entirely absent in indoor dust). 
Phylum-level fungal distributions identified by 18S or ITS regions showed very 
similar findings: a predominance of Ascomycota in indoor dust and Basidiomycota 
in outdoor CAPs. ITS sequencing of fungal genera in indoor dust showed 
significant proportions of Aureobasidium and Leptosphaerulina along with some 
contribution from Cryptococcus, Epicoccum, Aspergillus and the human commensal 
Malassezia. ITS sequencing detected more than 70 fungal genera in indoor dust 
not observed by culture. Microbiome sequencing is feasible for different types 
of archived environmental samples (indoor dust, and low biomass air particulate 
samples), and offers the potential to study how whole communities of microbes 
(including unculturable taxa) influence human health.

BACKGROUND: The development of the rumen is an important physiological challenge 
for young ruminants. Previous studies have shown that starter feeding can 
effectively facilitate the growth and development of the rumen in ruminants. 
However, the mechanism through which starter feeding stimulates the development 
of the rumen is not clear. Here, we performed an integrated analysis in ruminal 
microbiota and a host transcriptomic profile in a lamb model with the 
intervention of starter feed to understand the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk 
in stimulating the development of the ruminal epithelium.
RESULTS: Decreased ruminal pH and increased acetate and butyrate concentrations 
in the rumen, followed by increasing rumen organ index, were observed in lambs 
supplemented with starter. Using metagenome sequencing in combination with 16S 
rRNA and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the results showed the abundance of 
acetate-producing Mitsuokella spp., lactate-producing Sharpea spp., 
lactate-utilizing Megasphaera spp., and Entodinium spp. was enriched in rumen 
microbial communities in the starter-feed group. The abundances of genes 
involved in sugar degradation were decreased in starter-feed lambs, but the GH13 
encoding α-amylase was obviously increased. Rumen epithelial transcriptome 
analysis revealed that seven differentially expressed genes, including MAPK1, 
PIK3CB, TNFSF10, ITGA6, SNAI2, SAV1, and DLG, related to the cell growth module 
were upregulated, and BAD's promotion of cell death was downregulated. 
Correlation analysis revealed that the increase in the concentrations of acetate 
and butyrate significantly correlated with the expression of these genes, which 
indicates acetate and butyrate likely acted as important drivers in the ruminal 
microbiome-host crosstalk.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study comprehensively describes the symbiotic 
relationship between the rumen microbiota and the host in lambs after starter 
feeding. Our data demonstrates that the microbiome-driven generation of acetate 
and butyrate mediated the growth-related genes' regulation of the 
growth-associated signalling pathway in the ruminal epithelium. These 
co-development networks regulated many physiological processes in the 
epithelium, including papillae morphology and rumen epithelial growth.

Background: Early-life colonization of the intestinal tract is a dynamic process 
influenced by numerous factors. The impact of probiotic-supplemented infant 
formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well 
defined.Objective: We sought to determine the effects of a 
bifidobacteria-containing formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome 
during the first year of life.Design: A double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study of newborn infants assigned to a standard whey-based 
formula containing a total of 107 colony-forming units (CFU)/g of 
Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, B. 
longum subspecies infantis (intervention), or to a control formula without 
bifidobacteria (placebo). Breastfed controls were included. Diversity and 
composition of fecal microbiota were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
amplicon sequencing, and metabolite profiles were analyzed by 
ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry over a period of 2 
y.Results: Infants (n = 106) were randomly assigned to either the interventional 
(n = 48) or placebo (n = 49) group; 9 infants were exclusively breastfed 
throughout the entire intervention period of 12 mo. Infants exposed to 
bifidobacteria-supplemented formula showed decreased occurrence of Bacteroides 
and Blautia spp. associated with changes in lipids and unknown metabolites at 
month 1. Microbiota and metabolite profiles of intervention and placebo groups 
converged during the study period, and long-term colonization (24 mo) of the 
supplemented Bifidobacterium strains was not detected. Significant differences 
in microbiota and metabolites were detected between infants fed breast milk and 
those fed formula (P < 0.005) and between infants birthed vaginally and those 
birthed by cesarean delivery (P < 0.005). No significant differences were 
observed between infant feeding groups regarding growth, antibiotic uptake, or 
other health variables (P > 0.05).Conclusion: The supplementation of 
bifidobacteria to infant diet can modulate the occurrence of specific bacteria 
and metabolites during early life with no detectable long-term effects. This 
trial was registered at germanctr.de as DRKS00003660.

The potential impacts of mining activities on tropical coastal ecosystems are 
poorly understood. In particular, limited information is available on the 
effects of metals on scleractinian corals which are foundation species that form 
vital structural habitats supporting other biota. This study investigated the 
effects of dissolved nickel and copper on the coral Acropora muricata and its 
associated microbiota. Corals collected from the Great Barrier Reef were exposed 
to dissolved nickel (45, 90, 470, 900 and 9050 μg Ni/L) or copper (4, 11, 32 and 
65 μg Cu/L) in flow through chambers at the National Sea Simulator, Townsville, 
Qld, Australia. After a 96-h exposure DNA metabarcoding (16S rDNA and 18S rDNA) 
was undertaken on all samples to detect changes in the structure of the coral 
microbiome. The controls remained healthy throughout the study period. After 
36 h, bleaching was only observed in corals exposed to 32 and 65 μg Cu/L and 
very high nickel concentrations (9050 μg Ni/L). At 96 h, significant 
discolouration of corals was only observed in 470 and 900 μg Ni/L treatments, 
the highest concentrations tested. While high concentrations of nickel caused 
bleaching, no changes in the composition of their microbiome communities were 
observed. In contrast, exposure to copper not only resulted in bleaching, but 
altered the composition of both the eukaryote and bacterial communities of the 
coral's microbiomes. Our findings showed that these effects were only evident at 
relatively high concentrations of nickel and copper, reflecting concentrations 
observed only in extremely polluted environments. Elevated metal concentrations 
have the capacity to alter the microbiomes which are inherently linked to coral 
health.

BACKGROUND: Symbiosis is a phenomenon that allows organisms to colonise a wide 
range of environments and occupy a variety of ecological niches in marine 
environments. Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are crucial marine calcifiers 
that rely on photo-endosymbionts for growth and calcification, yet the influence 
of environmental conditions in shaping their interactions with prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic associates is poorly known.
RESULTS: Here, we used next-generation sequencing to identify eukaryotic 
photosynthesizing and prokaryotic microbes associated with the common LBF 
Amphistegina lobifera across a physio-chemical gradient on the Great Barrier 
Reef (GBR). We collected samples from three reef sites located in the inner-, 
mid- and outer-shelf regions of the northern section of the GBR. Results showed 
the consistent presence of Bacillaryophyta as the main eukaryotic taxa 
associated with A. lobifera across all reef sites analysed; however, the 
abundance and the diversity of prokaryotic organisms varied among reef sites. 
Inner-shelf specimens showed the highest diversity of prokaryote associates, 
with a total of 231 genotypes in their core microbiome. A total of 30 taxa were 
identified in the core microbiome across all reef sites. Within these taxa, 
Proteobacteria was the most abundant bacteria present. The presence of groups 
such as Actinobacteria was significantly correlated with inner-shelf 
populations, whereas the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was 
associated with A. lobifera collected from mid- and outer-shelf reef sites.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that benthic foraminifera form stable and persistent 
symbiosis with eukaryotic partners, but flexible and site-specific associations 
with prokaryotic microbes that likely influence the ecological success of these 
crucial calcifying organisms on the GBR.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is strongly associated with life style, especially 
dietary habits, which have gained attention as disease modifiers. Here, we 
report a fasting mimicking diet (FMD), fasting 3 days followed by 4 days of 
refeeding for three 1-week cycles, which accelerated the retention of motor 
function and attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra 
in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. Levels 
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), known to promote the survival of 
dopaminergic neurons, were increased in PD mice after FMD, suggesting an 
involvement of BDNF in FMD-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, FMD decreased 
the number of glial cells as well as the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in PD mice, 
showing that FMD also inhibited neuro-inflammation. 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing 
of fecal microbiota showed that FMD treatment modulated the shifts in gut 
microbiota composition, including higher abundance of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, 
and Opisthokonta and lower abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level in PD 
mice. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry revealed that FMD modulated the MPTP-induced lower propionic acid 
and isobutyric acid, and higher butyric acid and valeric acid and other 
metabolites. Transplantation of fecal microbiota, from normal mice with FMD 
treatment to antibiotic-pretreated PD mice increased dopamine levels in the 
recipient PD mice, suggesting that gut microbiota contributed to the 
neuroprotection of FMD for PD. These findings demonstrate that FMD can be a new 
means of preventing and treating PD through promoting a favorable gut microbiota 
composition and metabolites.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood. Recently, 
we identified a critical window early in the life of both mice and Canadian 
infants during which gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) affect asthma 
development. Given geographic differences in human gut microbiota worldwide, we 
studied the effects of gut microbial dysbiosis on atopic wheeze in a population 
living in a distinct developing world environment.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether microbial alterations in early infancy 
are associated with the development of atopic wheeze in a nonindustrialized 
setting.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within a birth cohort from 
rural Ecuador in which we identified 27 children with atopic wheeze and 70 
healthy control subjects at 5 years of age. We analyzed bacterial and eukaryotic 
gut microbiota in stool samples collected at 3 months of age using 16S and 18S 
sequencing. Bacterial metagenomes were predicted from 16S rRNA data by using 
Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States 
and categorized by function with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
ontology. Concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids were determined by 
using gas chromatography.
RESULTS: As previously observed in Canadian infants, microbial dysbiosis at 
3 months of age was associated with later development of atopic wheeze. However, 
the dysbiosis in Ecuadorian babies involved different bacterial taxa, was more 
pronounced, and also involved several fungal taxa. Predicted metagenomic 
analysis emphasized significant dysbiosis-associated differences in genes 
involved in carbohydrate and taurine metabolism. Levels of the fecal short-chain 
fatty acids acetate and caproate were reduced and increased, respectively, in 
the 3-month stool samples of children who went on to have atopic wheeze.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the importance of fungal and bacterial 
microbiota during the first 100 days of life on the development of atopic wheeze 
and provide additional support for considering modulation of the gut microbiome 
as a primary asthma prevention strategy.

Periodontitis is an extremely prevalent disease worldwide and is driven by 
complex dysbiotic microbiota. Here we analyzed the transcriptional activity of 
the periodontal pocket microbiota from all domains of life as well as the human 
host in health and chronic periodontitis. Bacteria showed strong enrichment of 
18 KEGG functional modules in chronic periodontitis, including bacterial 
chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, type III secretion system, type III CRISPR-Cas 
system, and two component system proteins. Upregulation of these functions was 
driven by the red-complex pathogens and candidate pathogens, e.g. Filifactor 
alocis, Prevotella intermedia, Fretibacterium fastidiosum and Selenomonas 
sputigena. Nine virulence factors were strongly up-regulated, among them the 
arginine deiminase arcA from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Mycoplasma arginini. 
Viruses and archaea accounted for about 0.1% and 0.22% of total putative mRNA 
reads, respectively, and a protozoan, Entamoeba gingivalis, was highly enriched 
in periodontitis. Fourteen human transcripts were enriched in periodontitis, 
including a gene for a ferric iron binding protein, indicating competition with 
the microbiota for iron, and genes associated with cancer, namely nucleolar 
phosphoprotein B23, ankyrin-repeat domain 30B-like protein and beta-enolase. The 
data provide evidence on the level of gene expression in vivo for the 
potentially severe impact of the dysbiotic microbiota on human health.

BACKGROUND: Microbial communities (microbiota) influence human and animal 
disease and immunity, geochemical nutrient cycling and plant productivity. 
Specific groups, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes or fungi, are amplified 
by PCR to assess the relative abundance of sub-groups (e.g. genera). However, 
neither the absolute abundance of sub-groups is revealed, nor can different 
amplicon families (i.e. OTUs derived from a specific pair of PCR primers such as 
bacterial 16S, eukaryotic 18S or fungi ITS) be compared. This prevents 
determination of the absolute abundance of a particular group and domain-level 
shifts in microbiota abundance can remain undetected.
RESULTS: We have developed absolute quantitation of amplicon families using 
synthetic chimeric DNA spikes. Synthetic spikes were added directly to 
environmental samples, co-isolated and PCR-amplified, allowing calculation of 
the absolute abundance of amplicon families (e.g. prokaryotic 16S, eukaryotic 
18S and fungal ITS per unit mass of sample).
CONCLUSIONS: Spikes can be adapted to any amplicon-specific group including 
rhizobia from soils, Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria from human gut or 
Enterobacteriaceae from food samples. Crucially, using highly complex soil 
samples, we show that the absolute abundance of specific groups can remain 
steady or increase, even when their relative abundance decreases. Thus, without 
absolute quantitation, the underlying pathology, physiology and ecology of 
microbial groups may be masked by their relative abundance.

Background and aim: Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory disease of the 
bowel, hypothetically induced by an immunologic response to a luminal microbial 
agent. We aimed to characterize the microbiome composition in MC and subtypes 
collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) and to identify a possible 
microbial effect of treatment. Method: Stool samples were collected from MC 
patients prior to treatment, at 8 weeks (during treatment) and at 16 weeks 
(after treatment), and from healthy controls, not receiving treatment, at 
matched time-points. Microbiome composition was analyzed by sequencing of the 
16S and 18S genes. Differences between patients and controls were analyzed by 
Shannon's diversity index (mean, standard deviation (SD)) and principal 
coordinate analysis (PCoA) complemented with a permanova test of UniFrac 
distances. Results: Ten LC patients, 10 CC patients and 10 controls were 
included. By PCoA, the bacterial composition in MC patients differed from 
controls at baseline (p = .02), but not during and after treatment (p = .09 and 
p = .33, respectively). At baseline, bacterial diversity was lower in MC 
patients compared to controls (2.5, SD: 0.5 vs 3.5, SD: 0.3, p < .05). Diversity 
in MC patients increased during (3.0, SD: 0.6) and after treatment and (2.9, SD: 
0.5) compared with baseline (p < .01). Eukaryotes were detected in fewer samples 
from MC patients compared with controls (11/20 (55%) vs. 9/10 (90%), p = .06) 
with no effect of treatment. Conclusion: Microbiome composition is altered in MC 
patients. During and after treatment with budesonide the microbiome composition 
in MC patients was driven towards the composition in healthy controls.

The root microbes play pivotal roles in plant productivity, nutrient uptakes, 
and disease resistance. The root microbial community structure has been 
extensively investigated by 16S/18S/ITS amplicons and metagenomic sequencing in 
crops and model plants. However, the functional associations between root 
microbes and host plant growth are poorly understood. This work investigates the 
root bacterial community of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and its potential 
effects on host plant productivity. We determined the bacterial composition of 
2882 samples from foxtail millet rhizoplane, rhizosphere and corresponding bulk 
soils from 2 well-separated geographic locations by 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequencing. We identified 16 109 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and defined 
187 OTUs as shared rhizoplane core OTUs. The β-diversity analysis revealed that 
microhabitat was the major factor shaping foxtail millet root bacterial 
community, followed by geographic locations. Large-scale association analysis 
identified the potential beneficial bacteria correlated with plant high 
productivity. Besides, the functional prediction revealed specific pathways 
enriched in foxtail millet rhizoplane bacterial community. We systematically 
described the root bacterial community structure of foxtail millet and found its 
core rhizoplane bacterial members. Our results demonstrated that host plants 
enrich specific bacteria and functions in the rhizoplane. The potentially 
beneficial bacteria may serve as a valuable knowledge foundation for 
bio-fertilizer development in agriculture.

Perturbations to the colonization process of the human gastrointestinal tract 
have been suggested to result in adverse health effects later in life. Although 
much research has been performed on bacterial colonization and succession, much 
less is known about the other two domains of life, archaea, and eukaryotes. Here 
we describe colonization and succession by bacteria, archaea and microeukaryotes 
during the first year of life (samples collected around days 1, 3, 5, 28, 150, 
and 365) within the gastrointestinal tract of infants delivered either vaginally 
or by cesarean section and using a combination of quantitative real-time PCR as 
well as 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sequences from organisms 
belonging to all three domains of life were detectable in all of the collected 
meconium samples. The microeukaryotic community composition fluctuated strongly 
over time and early diversification was delayed in infants receiving formula 
milk. Cesarean section-delivered (CSD) infants experienced a delay in 
colonization and succession, which was observed for all three domains of life. 
Shifts in prokaryotic succession in CSD infants compared to vaginally delivered 
(VD) infants were apparent as early as days 3 and 5, which were characterized by 
increased relative abundances of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, 
and a decrease in relative abundance for the genera Bifidobacterium and 
Bacteroides. Generally, a depletion in Bacteroidetes was detected as early as 
day 5 postpartum in CSD infants, causing a significantly increased 
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio between days 5 and 150 when compared to VD 
infants. Although the delivery mode appeared to have the strongest influence on 
differences between the infants, other factors such as a younger gestational age 
or maternal antibiotics intake likely contributed to the observed patterns as 
well. Our findings complement previous observations of a delay in colonization 
and succession of CSD infants, which affects not only bacteria but also archaea 
and microeukaryotes. This further highlights the need for resolving bacterial, 
archaeal, and microeukaryotic dynamics in future longitudinal studies of 
microbial colonization and succession within the neonatal gastrointestinal 
tract.

Recent studies report the presence of fungal species in breast milk of healthy 
mothers, suggesting a potential role in infant mycobiome development. In the 
present work, we aimed to determine whether the healthy human breast milk 
mycobiota is influenced by geographical location and mode of delivery, as well 
as to investigate its interaction with bacterial profiles in the same samples. A 
total of 80 mature breast milk samples from 4 different countries were analyzed 
by Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region, 
joining the 18S and 5.8S regions of the fungal rRNA region. Basidiomycota and 
Ascomycota were found to be the dominant phyla, with Malassezia and Davidiella 
being the most prevalent genera across countries. A core formed by Malassezia, 
Davidiella, Sistotrema, and Penicillium was shared in the milk samples from the 
different origins, although specific shifts in mycobiome composition were 
associated with geographic location and delivery mode. The presence of fungi in 
the breast milk samples was further confirmed by culture and isolate 
characterization, and fungal loads were estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
targeting the fungal ITS1 region. Cooccurrence network analysis of bacteria and 
fungi showed complex interactions that were influenced by geographical location, 
mode of delivery, maternal age, and pregestational body mass index. The presence 
of a breast milk mycobiome was confirmed in all samples analyzed, regardless of 
the geographic origin.IMPORTANCE During recent years, human breast milk has been 
documented as a potential source of bacteria for the newborn. Recently, we have 
reported the presence of fungi in breast milk from healthy mothers. It is well 
known that environmental and perinatal factors can affect milk bacteria; 
however, the impact on milk fungi is still unknown. The current report describes 
fungal communities (mycobiota) in breast milk samples across different 
geographic locations and the influence of the mode of delivery. We also provide 
novel insights on bacterium-fungus interactions, taking into account 
environmental and perinatal factors. We identified a core of four genera shared 
across locations, consisting of Malassezia, Davidiella, Sistotrema, and 
Penicillium, which have been reported to be present in the infant gut. Our data 
confirm the presence of fungi in breast milk across continents and support the 
potential role of breast milk in the initial seeding of fungal species in the 
infant gut.

This study aimed to evaluate whether the host genotype exerts any genetic 
control on the microbiome composition of the rumen in cattle. Microbial DNA was 
extracted from 18 samples of ruminal content from 2 breeds (Holstein and Brown 
Swiss). Reads were processed using mothur (https://www.mothur.org/) in 16S and 
18S rRNA gene-based analyses. Then, reads were classified at the genus clade, 
resulting in 3,579 operational taxonomic units (OTU) aligned against the 16S 
database and 184 OTU aligned against the 18S database. After filtering on 
relative abundance (>0.1%) and penetrance (95%), 25 OTU were selected for the 
analyses (17 bacteria, 1 archaea, and 7 ciliates). Association with the genetic 
background of the host animal based on the principal components of a genomic 
relationship matrix based on single nucleotide polymorphism markers was analyzed 
using Bayesian methods. Fifty percent of the bacteria and archaea genera were 
associated with the host genetic background, including Butyrivibrio, Prevotella, 
Paraprevotella, and Methanobrevibacter as main genera. Forty-three percent of 
the ciliates analyzed were also associated with the genetic background of the 
host. In total, 48% of microbes were associated with the host genetic 
background. The results in this study support the hypothesis and provide some 
evidence that there exists a host genetic component in cattle that can partially 
regulate the composition of the microbiome.

Although substantial efforts have been made to investigate about the composition 
of the microbiota, fungi that constitute the mycobiota play a pivotal role in 
maintaining microbial communities and physiological processes in the body. Here, 
we conducted an international survey focusing on laboratory's current procedures 
regarding their goals and practices of mycobiota characterisation using NGS. A 
questionnaire was proposed to laboratories affiliated to working groups from 
ECMM (NGS study group) and ESCMID (ESGHAMI and EFISG study groups). Twenty-six 
questionnaires from 18 countries were received. The use of NGS to characterise 
the mycobiota was not in routine for most of the laboratories (N = 23, 82%), and 
the main reason of using NGS was primary to understand the pathophysiology of a 
dysbiosis (N = 20), to contribute to a diagnosis (N = 16) or to implement a 
therapeutic strategy (N = 12). Other reported reasons were to evaluate the 
exposome (environmental studies) (N = 10) or to investigate epidemics (N = 8). 
Sputum is the main sample studied, and cystic fibrosis represents a major 
disease studied via the analysis of pulmonary microbiota. No consensus has 
emerged for the choice of the targets with 18S, ITS1 and ITS2 used alternatively 
among the laboratories. Other answers are detailed in the manuscript. We report 
a photography of mycobiota analysis that may become a major tool in the near 
future. We can draw some conclusions on the diversity of approaches within the 
answers of the 27 laboratories and underline the need for standardisation.

Fungal keratitis (FK) is one of the most severe corneal infectious diseases. FK 
often leads to poor visual prognosis and thus requires accurate diagnosis. 
Conventional approaches, including clinical diagnoses, smears, and cultures, 
often fail to provide reliable diagnostic value. Omics approaches, such as those 
using genomic, metagenomic, and tear proteomic data sources, provide promising 
features for improving the diagnosis and monitoring the progression of FK. 
Genomic approaches are based mainly on detecting amplicons of ribosomal RNA 
genes, and internal transcribed spacers are gradually gaining popularity in 
clinical practices. A metagenomic approach based on 16S rRNA genes may help 
monitor the dynamic change of conjunctival microbiota associated with an FK 
event, whereas that based on shot-gun and 18S rRNA target enrichment sequencing 
could have the potential to diagnose FK using clinical samples. A tear proteomic 
approach may provide comprehensive information about ocular surface defense and 
injury during FK. Representative up- and down-regulated proteins during FK could 
also be used as biomarkers to determine the clinical course and develop a 
treatment strategy in different stages of FK. Consequently, a personalized tear 
proteomic approach will soon play a key role in FK management.

Cooling towers for heating, ventilation and air conditioning are ubiquitous in 
the built environment. Often located on rooftops, their semi-open water basins 
provide a suitable environment for microbial growth. They are recognized as a 
potential source of bacterial pathogens and have been associated with disease 
outbreaks such as Legionnaires' disease. While measures to minimize public 
health risks are in place, the general microbial and protist community structure 
and dynamics in these systems remain largely elusive. In this study, we analysed 
the microbiome of the bulk water from the basins of three cooling towers by 16S 
and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing over the course of one year. Bacterial 
diversity in all three towers was broadly comparable to other freshwater 
systems, yet less diverse than natural environments; the most abundant taxa are 
also frequently found in freshwater or drinking water. While each cooling tower 
had a pronounced site-specific microbial community, taxa shared among all 
locations mainly included groups generally associated with biofilm formation. We 
also detected several groups related to known opportunistic pathogens, such as 
Legionella, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas species, albeit at generally low 
abundance. Although cooling towers represent a rather stable environment, 
microbial community composition was highly dynamic and subject to seasonal 
change. Protists are important members of the cooling tower water microbiome and 
known reservoirs for bacterial pathogens. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and 
protist taxa successfully captured known interactions between amoeba-associated 
bacteria and their hosts, and predicted a large number of additional 
relationships involving ciliates and other protists. Together, this study 
provides an unbiased and comprehensive overview of microbial diversity of 
cooling tower water basins, establishing a framework for investigating and 
assessing public health risks associated with these man-made freshwater 
environments.

Conventional assessments of ecosystem sample composition are based on 
morphology-based or DNA barcode identification of individuals. Both approaches 
are costly and time-consuming, especially when applied to the large number of 
specimens and taxa commonly included in ecological investigations. 
Next-generation sequencing approaches can overcome the bottleneck of individual 
specimen isolation and identification by simultaneously sequencing specimens of 
all taxa in a bulk mixture. Here we apply multiple parallel amplification 
primers, multiple DNA barcode markers, 454-pyrosequencing, and Illumina MiSeq 
sequencing to the same sample to maximize recovery of the arthropod macrobiome 
and the bacterial and other microbial microbiome of a bulk arthropod sample. We 
validate this method with a complex sample containing 1,066 morphologically 
distinguishable arthropods from a tropical terrestrial ecosystem with high 
taxonomic diversity. Multiamplicon next-generation DNA barcoding was able to 
recover sequences corresponding to 91% of the distinguishable individuals in a 
bulk environmental sample, as well as many species present as undistinguishable 
tissue. 454-pyrosequencing was able to recover 10 more families of arthropods 
and 30 more species than did conventional Sanger sequencing of each individual 
specimen. The use of other loci (16S and 18S ribosomal DNA gene regions) also 
added the detection of species of microbes associated with these terrestrial 
arthropods. This method greatly decreases the time and money necessary to 
perform DNA-based comparisons of biodiversity among ecosystem samples. This 
methodology opens the door to much cheaper and increased capacity for ecological 
and evolutionary studies applicable to a wide range of socio-economic issues, as 
well as a basic understanding of how the world works.

BACKGROUND: Application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to genomic DNA 
extracted from sewage offers a unique and cost-effective opportunity to study 
the genetic diversity of intestinal parasites. In this study, we used 
amplicon-based NGS to reveal and differentiate several common luminal intestinal 
parasitic protists, specifically Entamoeba, Endolimax, Iodamoeba, and 
Blastocystis, in sewage samples from Swedish treatment plants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Influent sewage samples were subject to gradient 
centrifugation, DNA extraction and PCR-based amplification using three primer 
pairs designed for amplification of eukaryotic nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA. PCR 
products were sequenced using ILLUMINA® technology, and resulting sequences were 
annotated to species and subtype level using the in-house BION software, 
sequence clustering, and phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 26 samples from eight treatment plants in central/southern 
Sweden were analysed. Blastocystis sp. and Entamoeba moshkovskii were detected 
in all samples, and most samples (n = 20) were positive for Entamoeba coli. 
Moreover, we detected Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar, Entamoeba 
hartmanni, Endolimax nana, and Iodamoeba bütschlii in 1, 11, 4, 10, and 7 
samples, respectively. The level of genetic divergence observed within E. nana 
and E. moshkovskii was 20.2% and 7.7%, respectively, across the ~400-bp region 
studied, and two clades of E. moshkovskii were found. As expected, Blastocystis 
sp. subtypes 1-4 were present in almost all samples; however, ST8 was present in 
10 samples and was the only subtype not commonly found in humans that was 
present in multiple samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Entamoeba and Blastocystis were identified as universal members of 
the "sewage microbiome". Blastocystis sp. ST8, which has been rarely reported in 
humans, was a very common finding, indicating that a hitherto unidentified but 
common host of ST8 contributed to the sewage influent. The study also provided 
substantial new insight into the intra-generic diversity of Entamoeba and 
Endolimax.

Airborne microbes (bacteria, archaea, protists, and fungi) were surveyed over a 
7-y period via high-throughput massive sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes in 
rain and snow samples collected fortnightly at a high-elevation mountain 
Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network site (LTER-Aigüestortes, Central 
Pyrenees, Spain). This survey constitutes the most comprehensive mountain-top 
aerobiology study reported to date. The air mass origins were tracked through 
modeled back-trajectories and analysis of rain water chemical composition. 
Consistent microbial seasonal patterns were observed with highly divergent 
summer and winter communities recurrent in time. Indicative microbial taxa were 
unveiled as a forensic signature, and ubiquitous taxa were observed as common 
atmosphere inhabitants, highlighting aerosols as a potentially successful 
mechanism for global microbial dispersal. Source-tracking analyses identified 
freshwater, cropland, and urban biomes as the most important sources for 
airborne bacteria in summer, while marine and forest biomes prevailed in winter, 
in agreement with air mass retrotrajectories and the prevailing general and 
regional atmospheric circulation.

BACKGROUND: Targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) of the 16S rRNA gene is 
commonly used to explore and characterize bacterial microbiomes. Meanwhile, 
attempts to apply TADS to the detection and characterization of entire parasitic 
communities have been hampered since conserved regions of many conserved 
parasite genes, such as the 18S rRNA gene, are also conserved in their 
eukaryotic hosts. As a result, targeted amplification of 18S rRNA from clinical 
samples using universal primers frequently results in competitive priming and 
preferential amplification of host DNA. Here, we describe a novel method that 
employs a single pair of universal primers to capture all blood-borne parasites 
while reducing host 18S rRNA template and enhancing the amplification of 
parasite 18S rRNA for TADS. This was achieved using restriction enzymes to 
digest the 18S rRNA gene at cut sites present only in the host sequence prior to 
PCR amplification.
RESULTS: This method was validated against 16 species of blood-borne helminths 
and protozoa. Enzyme digestion prior to PCR enrichment and Illumina amplicon 
deep sequencing led to a substantial reduction in human reads and a 
corresponding 5- to 10-fold increase in parasite reads relative to undigested 
samples. This method allowed for discrimination of all common parasitic agents 
found in human blood, even in cases of multi-parasite infection, and markedly 
reduced the limit of detection in digested versus undigested samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The results herein provide a novel methodology for the reduction of 
host DNA prior to TADS and establish the validity of a next-generation 
sequencing-based platform for universal parasite detection.

BACKGROUND: Our understanding of fungi in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been 
limited by previously employed detection techniques. This study examines the 
fungal component of the microbiome in CRS patients and controls using a highly 
sensitive culture-independent molecular technique. The aims of this study 
include the characterization of fungal richness, prevalence, abundance, temporal 
changes, and their relationship with patient outcomes.
METHODS: Swabs were collected from the sinuses of 23 CRS patients and 11 
controls. Collection occurred intraoperatively, and at 6 and 12 weeks 
postoperatively. DNA was extracted from the swabs and fungal outcomes were 
determined through 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fungal tag-encoded FLX amplicon 
pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: Fungi were ubiquitous to all patients. A total of 207 fungal genera 
were detected, with a mean sample richness of 8.18 and 12.14 in the control and 
CRS groups, respectively. Malassezia was detected in all patients at surgery and 
was also the most abundant. Postoperatively, fungal richness decreased (p < 
0.05) and was associated with declines in the prevalence of Fusarium and 
Neocosmospora (p < 0.05). Neocosmospora was also less abundant postoperatively 
(p < 0.05). No correlations were found with quality of life.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use a highly sensitive pyrosequencing 
technique to reveal the true diversity of fungi in the sinuses of CRS patients 
and postoperative changes in richness. The presence of Malassezia, a genus not 
previously described in the sinuses, is of great interest, and its potential as 
a disease modifier should see further investigation given its association with 
atopic disease.

Although many studies have confirmed that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs: PBD-mI 
and LUC-n) can be used as feed additives, there are few reports of their use in 
ruminants. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of AMPs on 
ameliorating rumen fermentation function and rumen microorganisms in goats. 
Eighteen 4-month-old Chuanzhong black goats were used in a 60-day experiment (6 
goats per group). Group I was used as the control and was fed a basal diet, the 
group II were fed the basal diet supplemented with 2 g of AMPs [per goat/day] 
and group III were fed the basal diet supplemented 3 g of AMPs [per goat/day], 
respectively. Rumen fluid samples were collected at 0, 20 and 60 days. Bacterial 
16S rRNA genes and ciliate protozoal 18S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR from 
DNA extracted from rumen samples. The amplicons were sequenced by Illumina 
MiSeq. Rumen fermentation parameters and digestive enzyme activities were also 
examined. Our results showed that dietary supplementation with AMPs increased 
the levels of the bacterial genera Fibrobacter, Anaerovibrio and 
Succiniclasticum and also increased the ciliates genus Ophryoscolex, but reduced 
the levels of the bacterial genera Selenomonas, Succinivibrio and Treponema, and 
the ciliate genera Polyplastron, Entodinium, Enoploplastron and Isotricha. 
Supplementation with AMPs increased the activities of xylanase, pectinase and 
lipase in the rumen, and also increased the concentrations of acetic acid, 
propionic acid and total volatile fatty acids. These changes were associated 
with improved growth performance in the goats. The results revealed that the 
goats fed AMPs showed improved rumen microbiota structures, altered ruminal 
fermentation, and improved efficiency regarding the utilization of feed; thereby 
indicating that AMPs can improve growth performance. AMPs are therefore suitable 
as feed additives in juvenile goats.

Microbial community analysis via high-throughput sequencing of amplified 16S 
rRNA genes is an essential microbiology tool. We found the popular primer pair 
515F (515F-C) and 806R greatly underestimated (e.g. SAR11) or overestimated 
(e.g. Gammaproteobacteria) common marine taxa. We evaluated marine samples and 
mock communities (containing 11 or 27 marine 16S clones), showing alternative 
primers 515F-Y (5'-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5'-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) yield 
more accurate estimates of mock community abundances, produce longer amplicons 
that can differentiate taxa unresolvable with 515F-C/806R, and amplify 
eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer 
observed community composition versus expected (r(2)  = 0.95) compared with 
515F-Y/806R (r(2)  ∼ 0.5). Unexpectedly, biases with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 
in field samples (∼4-10-fold) were stronger than in mock communities (∼2-fold). 
Correcting a mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent 
abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather than 806R. With 
plankton samples rich in eukaryotic DNA (> 1 μm size fraction), 18S sequences 
averaged ∼17% of all sequences. A single mismatch can strongly bias 
amplification, but even perfectly matched primers can exhibit preferential 
amplification. We show that beyond in silico predictions, testing with mock 
communities and field samples is important in primer selection.

BACKGROUND: Human-associated microbial communities include fungi, but we 
understand little about which fungal species are present, their relative and 
absolute abundances, and how antimicrobial therapy impacts fungal communities. 
The disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often involves chronic airway colonization by 
bacteria and fungi, and these infections cause irreversible lung damage. Fungi 
are detected more frequently in CF sputum samples upon initiation of 
antimicrobial therapy, and several studies have implicated the detection of 
fungi in sputum with worse outcomes. Thus, a more complete understanding of 
fungi in CF is required.
RESULTS: We characterized the fungi and bacteria in expectorated sputa from six 
CF subjects. Samples were collected upon admission for systemic antibacterial 
therapy and upon the completion of treatment and analyzed using a 
pyrosequencing-based analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and 
bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. A mixture of Candida species and Malassezia 
dominated the mycobiome in all samples (74%-99% of fungal reads). There was not 
a striking trend correlating fungal and bacterial richness, and richness showed 
a decline after antibiotic therapy particularly for the bacteria. The fungal 
communities within a sputum sample resembled other samples from that subject 
despite the aggressive antibacterial therapy. Quantitative PCR analysis of 
fungal 18S rDNA sequences to assess fungal burden showed variation in fungal 
density in sputum before and after antibacterial therapy but no consistent 
directional trend. Analysis of Candida ITS1 sequences amplified from sputum or 
pure culture-derived genomic DNA from individual Candida species found little 
(<0.5%) or no variation in ITS1 sequences within or between strains, thereby 
validating this locus for the purpose of Candida species identification. We also 
report the enhancement of the publically available Visualization and Analysis of 
Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) tool for the analysis of fungal 
communities in clinical samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Fungi are present in CF respiratory sputum. In CF, the use of 
intravenous antibiotic therapy often does not profoundly impact bacterial 
community structure, and we observed a similar stability in fungal species 
composition. Further studies are required to predict the effects of 
antibacterials on fungal burden in CF and fungal community stability in non-CF 
populations.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani remains of public 
health concern in rural India. Those at risk of VL are also at risk of other 
neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil transmitted helminths. 
Intestinal helminths are potent regulators of host immune responses sometimes 
mediated through cross-talk with gut microbiota. We evaluate a meta-taxonomic 
approach to determine the composition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gut 
microflora using amplicon-based sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and 
18S rRNA gene regions. The most abundant bacterial taxa identified in faecal 
samples from Bihar State India were Prevotella (37.1%), Faecalibacterium 
(11.3%), Escherichia-Shigella (9.1%), Alloprevotella (4.5%), Bacteroides (4.1%), 
Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 (1.6%), and Bifidobacterium (1.5%). Eukaryotic taxa 
identified (excluding plant genera) included Blastocystis (57.9%; Order: 
Stramenopiles), Dientamoeba (12.1%; Family: Tritrichomonadea), Pentatrichomonas 
(10.1%; Family: Trichomonodea), Entamoeba (3.5%; Family: Entamoebida), 
Ascaridida (0.8%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with Ascaris by microscopy), 
Rhabditida (0.8%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with Strongyloides), and 
Cyclophyllidea (0.2%; Order: Eucestoda; concordant with Hymenolepis). Overall 
alpha (Shannon's, Faith's and Pielou's indices) and beta (Bray-Curtis 
dissimilarity statistic; weighted UniFrac distances) diversity of taxa did not 
differ significantly by age, sex, geographic subdistrict, or VL case (N = 23) 
versus endemic control (EC; N = 23) status. However, taxon-specific associations 
occurred: (i) Ruminococcaceae UCG- 014 and Gastranaerophilales_uncultured 
bacterium were enriched in EC compared to VL cases; (ii) Pentatrichomonas was 
more abundant in VL cases than in EC, whereas the reverse occurred for 
Entamoeba. Across the cohort, high Escherichia-Shigella was associated with 
reduced bacterial diversity, while high Blastocystis was associated with high 
bacterial diversity and low Escherichia-Shigella. Individuals with high 
Blastocystis had low Bacteroidaceae and high Clostridiales vadin BB60 whereas 
the reverse held true for low Blastocystis. This scoping study provides useful 
baseline data upon which to develop a broader analysis of pathogenic enteric 
microflora and their influence on gut microbial health and NTDs generally.

OBJECTIVE: A low prevalence of intestinal parasites has been identified in 
individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but potential associations with 
alterations in the bacterial microbiome remain largely unexplored. We aimed to 
investigate the relationship between parasites and bacteria in individuals with 
IBS in order to identify potential trans-kingdom microbial characteristics.
DESIGN: Stool samples were collected from the Danish background population 
classified into IBS (n = 119), unspecific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms 
(n = 114), and asymptomatic controls (n = 186) based on the Rome III criteria 
for IBS. Bacterial (16S) and eukaryotic (18S) ribosomal DNA was sequenced, and 
18S data were merged with data from conventional parasite laboratory tests. The 
bacterial microbiome was analyzed according to symptom group and parasite 
colonization status.
RESULTS: Bacterial richness and diversity were similar for IBS and controls but 
higher in those with unspecific GI symptoms. A higher abundance of Bacteroides 
and a lower abundance of Faecalibacterium were detected in individuals with IBS 
and unspecific GI symptoms compared with controls. Principal component analyses 
indicated differences in bacterial composition related to parasite colonization 
rather than symptom group. Parasites were detected at the lowest frequency in 
the IBS group (39%) and in samples dominated by Bacteroides. Higher bacterial 
richness and diversity were found in parasite-positive samples from controls and 
those with unspecific GI symptoms but not in individuals with IBS.
CONCLUSION: Parasite colonization, rather than bacterial composition, differed 
between individuals with IBS and healthy controls. Parasite colonization was 
associated to a rich and diverse bacterial microbiome; however, this association 
was altered in IBS.

BACKGROUND: Congenital malaria is usually defined as the detection of asexual 
forms of Plasmodium spp. in a blood sample of a neonate during perinatal age if 
there is no possibility of postpartum infection by a mosquito bite. The 
incidence of congenital malaria is highly variable and seems related to several 
factors, such as different diagnostic methods for Plasmodium spp. detection, and 
area in which the epidemiologic analyses are performed. In non-endemic 
countries, cases of congenital malaria are rare. Hereby, a case of a congenital 
malaria in an HIV exposed child is reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-month-old male child was admitted to Bambino Gesù 
Children's Hospital due to anaemia and exposure to HIV. He was born prematurely 
in Italy by cesarean section at 34 weeks' gestation after a bicorial, biamniotic 
pregnancy by a migrant woman from Nigeria. He was the first of non-identical 
twins. Combined with anaemia, spleen and liver enlargement was noted, malaria 
was hypothesized. Malaria laboratory panel was performed on the newborn, mother 
and other twin blood samples, as follows: (i) malaria rapid diagnostic test 
(RDT); (ii) Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears for Plasmodium spp. 
identification and parasitaemia titration; (iii) molecular screening and typing 
of Plasmodium spp. by multiplex qualitative PCR assay based on 18S rRNA gene. 
Genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from mother and child was performed 
by neutral microsatellite and highly polymorphic marker amplification.
CONCLUSIONS: The maternal RDT sample was negative, while the infant RDT was 
positive; in both cases microscopy of blood smears and PCR showed infection with 
P. falciparum. Two of the genotypic molecular markers displayed different 
allelic variants between the two samples. This difference could imply infection 
multiplicity of the mother during the pregnancy, possibly harbouring more than 
one isolate, only one of them being transmitted to the newborn while the other 
persisting in the mother's blood. Because of the increasing number of pregnant 
women coming from endemic areas for malaria, an accurate anamnesis of infant's 
mother, and the inclusion of Plasmodium spp. research into TORCH screenings for 
mother-infant pair at birth, aiming at reducing morbidity and mortality 
associated to the disease might be suitable.

High-Throughput Sequencing technologies are providing unprecedented inventories 
of microbial communities in aquatic samples, offering an invaluable tool to 
estimate the impact of anthropogenic pressure on marine communities. In this 
case study, the Mediterranean touristic site of Aci Castello (Italy) was 
investigated by High-Throughput Sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes. The 
sampling area falls within a Marine Protected Area and, notwithstanding, 
features an untreated urban wastewater discharge. Seawater samples were 
collected close to the wastewater output (COL) and at a second station about 400 
m further off (PAN), before and after a summer increase in population. 
Prokaryotic communities clustered according to stations, rather than to seasons. 
While PAN showed a typical, not impacted, marine microbial composition, COL was 
consistently enriched in Epsilonproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Protist 
communities showed a peculiar clustering, as COL at springtime stood alone and 
was dominated by Ciliophora, while the other samples were enriched in Dinophyta. 
Analysis of alternative, detectable by High-Throughput Sequencing, microbial 
indicators, including both faecal- and sewage-associated, allowed uncovering the 
different sources of pollution in coastal and anthropogenically impacted marine 
ecosystems, underpinning the relevance of High-Throughput Sequencing-based 
screening as rapid and precise method for water quality management.

German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (Blattodea: Ectobiidae), are human 
commensals that move freely between food and waste, disseminating bacteria, 
including potential pathogens, through their feces. However, the relationship 
between the microbial communities of the cockroach gut and feces is poorly 
understood. We analyzed the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the V9 region of 
the 18S rRNA gene by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to compare the bacterial 
and protist diversities in guts versus feces and males versus females, as well 
as assess variation across cockroach populations. Cockroaches harbored a diverse 
array of bacteria, and 80 to 90% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were 
shared between the feces and gut. Lab-reared and field-collected cockroaches had 
distinct microbiota, and whereas lab-reared cockroaches had relatively conserved 
communities, considerable variation was observed in the microbial community 
composition of cockroaches collected in different apartments. Nonetheless, 
cockroaches from all locations shared some core bacterial taxa. The eukaryotic 
community in the feces of field-collected cockroaches was found to be more 
diverse than that in lab-reared cockroaches. These results demonstrate that 
cockroaches disseminate their gut microbiome in their feces, and they underscore 
the important contribution of the cockroach fecal microbiome to the microbial 
diversity of cockroach-infested homes.IMPORTANCE The German cockroach infests 
diverse human-built structures, including homes and hospitals. It produces 
potent allergens that trigger asthma and disseminates opportunistic pathogens in 
its feces. A comprehensive understanding of gut and fecal microbial communities 
of cockroaches is essential not only to understand their contribution to the 
biology of the cockroach, but also for exploring their clinical relevance. In 
this study, we compare the diversity of bacteria and eukaryotes in the cockroach 
gut and feces and assess the variation in the gut microbiota across cockroach 
populations.

Aquatic ecosystems in the High Arctic are facing unprecedented changes as a 
result of global warming effects on the cryosphere. Snow pack is a central 
feature of northern landscapes, but the snow microbiome and its microbial 
connectivity to adjacent and downstream habitats have been little explored. To 
evaluate these aspects, we sampled along a hydrologic continuum at Ward Hunt 
Lake (latitude 83°N) in the Canadian High Arctic, from snow banks, water tracks 
in the permafrost catchment, the upper and lower strata of the lake, and the 
lake outlet and its coastal marine mixing zone. The microbial communities were 
analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16 and 18S rRNA to determine the 
composition of potentially active Bacteria, Archaea and microbial Eukarya. Each 
habitat had distinct microbial assemblages, with highest species richness in the 
subsurface water tracks that connected the melting snow to the lake. However, up 
to 30% of phylotypes were shared along the hydrologic continuum, showing that 
many taxa originating from the snow can remain in the active fraction of 
downstream microbiomes. The results imply that changes in snowfall associated 
with climate warming will affect microbial community structure throughout all 
spatially connected habitats within snow-fed polar ecosystems.

Rumen microbiome profiling uses 16S rRNA (18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer) 
gene sequencing, a method that usually sequences a small portion of a single 
gene and is often biased and varies between different laboratories. Functional 
information can be inferred from this data, but only for those that are closely 
related to known annotated species, and even then may not truly reflect the 
function performed within the environment being studied. Genome sequencing of 
isolates and metagenome-assembled genomes has now reached a stage where 
representation of the majority of rumen bacterial genera are covered, but this 
still only represents a portion of rumen microbial species. The creation of a 
microbial genome (bins) database with associated functional annotations will 
provide a consistent reference to allow mapping of RNA-Seq reads for functional 
gene analysis from within the rumen microbiome. The integration of multiple omic 
analytics is linking functional gene activity, metabolic pathways and rumen 
metabolites with the responsible microbiota, supporting our biological 
understanding of the rumen system. The application of these techniques has 
advanced our understanding of the major microbial populations and functional 
pathways that are used in relation to lower methane emissions, higher feed 
efficiencies and responses to different feeding regimes. Continued and more 
precise use of these tools will lead to a detailed and comprehensive 
understanding of compositional and functional capacity and design of techniques 
for the directed intervention and manipulation of the rumen microbiota towards a 
desired state.

Bats can be divided into frugivory, nectarivory, insectivory, and sanguivory 
based on their diets, and are therefore ideal wild animal models to study the 
relationship between diets and intestinal microflora. Early studies of bat gut 
bacteria showed that the diversity and structure of intestinal bacterial 
communities in bats are closely related to dietary changes. Worthy of note, 
intestinal microbes are composed of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. 
Although the number of gut fungi is much lower than that of gut bacteria, they 
also play an important role in maintaining the host homeostasis. However, there 
are still few reports on the relationship between the gut mycobiota and the 
dietary habits of the host. In addition, bats have also been shown to naturally 
transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria through their feces and saliva, but 
fungal infections from bat are less studied. Here, we used high-throughput 
sequencing of bacterial 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes in the V4 and V9 
regions to characterize fecal bacterial and fungal microbiota in phytophagous 
and insectivorous bats in South China. The results show that the gut microbiota 
in bats were dominated by bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, 
Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes, and fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. 
There was a significant difference in the diversity of bacterial and fungal 
microbiota between the groups, in addition to specific bacteria and fungi 
populations on each of them. Of note, the number of fungi in the feces of 
herbivorous bats is relatively higher. Most of these fungi are foodborne and are 
also pathogens of humans and other animals. Thus, bats are natural carriers of 
fungal pathogens. The current study expands the understanding of the bat gut 
bacterial and fungal mycobiota and provides further insight into the 
transmission of fungal pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Plants are colonized by a great diversity of microorganisms which 
form a microbiota and perform additional functions for their host. This 
microbiota can thus be considered a toolbox enabling plants to buffer local 
environmental changes, with a positive influence on plant fitness. In this 
context, the transmission of the microbiota to the progeny represent a way to 
ensure the presence of beneficial symbionts within the habitat. Examples of such 
transmission have been mainly described for seed transmission and concern a few 
pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the transmission of symbiotic 
partners to plant progeny within clonal plant network.
METHODS: We used the clonal plant Glechoma hederacea as plant model and forced 
newly emitted clonal progeny to root in separated pots while controlling the 
presence of microorganisms. We used an amplicon sequencing approach of 16S and 
18S rRNA targeting bacteria/archaea and fungi respectively to describe the root 
microbiota of mother and clonal-plant offspring.
RESULTS: We demonstrated the vertical transmission of a significant proportion 
of the mother plants' symbiotic bacteria and fungi to the daughters. 
Interestingly, archaea were not transmitted to the daughter plants. Transmitted 
communities had lower richness, suggesting a filtration during transmission. We 
found that the transmitted pool of microorganisms was similar among daughters, 
constituting the heritability of a specific cohort of microorganisms, opening a 
new understanding of the plant holobiont. We also found significant effects of 
distance to the mother plant and of growth time on the richness of the 
microbiota transmitted.
CONCLUSIONS: In this clonal plant, microorganisms are transmitted between 
individuals through connections, thereby ensuring the availability of microbe 
partners for the newborn plants as well as the dispersion between hosts for the 
microorganisms. This previously undescribed ecological process allows the 
dispersal of microorganisms in space and across plant generations. As the vast 
majority of plants are clonal, this process might be therefore a strong driver 
of ecosystem functioning and assembly of plant and microorganism communities in 
a wide range of ecosystems.

Soil microbiome and multi-trophic relationships are essential for the stability 
and functioning of agroecosystems. However, little is known about how farming 
systems and alternative methods for controlling plant pathogens modulate 
microbial communities, soil mesofauna and plant productivity. In this study, we 
assessed the composition of eukaryotic microbial groups using a high-throughput 
sequencing approach (18S rRNA gene marker), the populations of parasitic and 
free-living nematodes, plant productivity and their inter-relationships in 
long-term conventional and organic farming systems. The diversity of the fungal 
community increased in the organic farming system compared to the conventional 
farming system, whereas the diversity of the protist community was similar 
between the two farming systems. Compared to conventional farming, organic 
farming increased the population of free-living nematodes and suppressed plant 
parasitic nematodes belonging to Meloidogynidae and Pratylenchidae. Fungal 
diversity and community structure appeared to be related to nematode suppression 
in the system receiving organic fertilizer, which was characterized by component 
microbial groups known to be involved in the suppression of soil pathogens. 
Unraveling the microbiome and multi-trophic interactions in different farming 
systems may permit the management of the soil environment toward more 
sustainable control of plant pathogens.

Microbial mats are ubiquitous in polar freshwater ecosystems and sustain high 
concentrations of biomass despite the extreme seasonal variations in light and 
temperature. Here we aimed to resolve genomic adaptations for light-harvesting, 
bright-light protection, and carbon flow in mats that undergo seasonal 
freeze-up. To bracket a range of communities in shallow water habitats, we 
sampled cyanobacterial mats in the thawed littoral zone of two lakes situated at 
the northern and southern limits of the Canadian Arctic permafrost zone. We 
applied a multiphasic approach using pigment profiles from high performance 
liquid chromatography, Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes, 
and metagenomic analysis. The mats shared a taxonomic and functional core 
microbiome, dominated by oxygenic cyanobacteria with light-harvesting and 
photoprotective pigments, bacteria with bacteriochlorophyll, and bacteria with 
light-driven Type I rhodopsins. Organisms able to use light for energy related 
processes represented up to 85% of the total microbial community, with 15-30% 
attributable to cyanobacteria and 55-70% attributable to other bacteria. The 
proportion of genes involved in anaplerotic CO2 fixation was greater than for 
genes associated with oxygenic photosynthesis. Diverse heterotrophic bacteria, 
eukaryotes (including metazoans and fungi) and viruses co-occurred in both 
communities. The results indicate a broad range of strategies for capturing 
sunlight and CO2, and for the subsequent flow of energy and carbon in these 
complex, light-driven microbial ecosystems.

PURPOSE: The study aims to explore the characteristic microorganisms of the 
common tongue coatings in patients with gastric cancer (GC).
METHODS: A total of 115 GC patients were assigned to four groups: White-thin 
coating (W-thin) group, White-thick coating (W-thick) group, Yellow-thin coating 
(Y-thin) group and Yellow-thick coating (Y-thick) group. Thirty-five healthy 
volunteers with White-thin coating were recruit as controls. High-throughput 
sequencing was used to describe the microbial community of the tongue coatings 
based on 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. Multi-factors statistical analysis was 
carried out to present the microbial biomarkers of the tongue coating in GC 
patients.
RESULTS: At bacterial phylum level, Saccharibacteria had higher relative 
abundance in W-thick group than W-thin group, Proteobacteria was more abundant 
in W-thin group than Y-thick group and less abundant in Y-thick group than 
Y-thin group. At fungal genus level, Guehomyces and Aspergillus presented to be 
significantly different among the common tongue coatings. Forteen significantly 
increased taxa were sorted out as the microbial biomarkers of common tongue 
coatings by LEfSe and ROC analysis. At species level, bacterial Capnocytophaga 
leadbetteri and fungal Ampelomyces_sp_IRAN_1 may be the potential biomarkers of 
W-thin coating, four bacterial species (Megasphaera micronuciformis, Selenomonas 
sputigena ATCC 35185, Acinetobacter ursingii, Prevotella maculosa) may be the 
potential biomarkers of W-thick coating. In general, the white coatings held 
more complex commensal relationship than the yellow coatings.
CONCLUSION: The common tongue coating owned characteristic microorganisms and 
special commensal relationship in the GC patients.

Bacteria, fungi and green algae are common inhabitants of coral skeletons. Their 
diversity is poorly characterized because they are difficult to identify with 
microscopy or environmental sequencing, as common metabarcoding markers have low 
phylogenetic resolution and miss a large portion of the biodiversity. We used a 
cost-effective protocol and a combination of markers (tufA, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA 
and 23S rDNA) to characterize the microbiome of 132 coral skeleton samples. We 
identified a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, many never 
reported in corals before. We additionally investigated the phylogenetic 
diversity of the green algae-the most abundant eukaryotic member of this 
community, for which previous literature recognizes only a handful of endolithic 
species. We found more than 120 taxonomic units (near species level), including 
six family-level lineages mostly new to science. The results suggest that the 
existence of lineages with an endolithic lifestyle predates the existence of 
modern scleractinian corals by ca. 250my, and that this particular niche was 
independently invaded by over 20 lineages in green algae evolution. These 
results highlight the potential of the multi-marker approach to assist in 
species discovery and, when combined with a phylogenetic framework, clarify the 
evolutionary origins of host-microbiota associations.

The majority of seafood is farmed, with most finfish coming from freshwater 
ponds. Ponds are often fertilized to promote microbial productivity as a natural 
feed source to fish. To understand if pond fertilization with livestock manure 
induces a probiotic or prebiotic effect, we communally reared tilapia 
(Oreochromis shiranus), and North African catfish (Clarias gariepinus), for 
4 weeks under seven manure treatments including layer chicken, broiler chicken, 
guinea fowl, quail, pig, cow, vs. commercial feed to evaluate microbial 
community dynamics of the manure, pond water, and fish feces using 16S and 18S 
rRNA marker genes along with metagenome sequencing. Catfish growth, but not 
tilapia, was positively associated with plankton abundance (p = 0.0006, R2 
 = 0.4887) and greatest in ponds fertilized with quail manure (ANOVA, p < 0.05). 
Manure was unique and influenced the 16S microbiome in pond water, tilapia gut, 
and catfish gut and 18S community in pond water and catfish guts (PERMANOVA, 
p = 0.001). On average, 18.5%, 18.6%, and 45.3% of manure bacteria sOTUs, 
(sub-operational taxonomic units), were present in the water column, catfish 
feces, and tilapia feces which comprised 3.7%, 12.8%, and 10.9% of the total 
microbial richness of the communities, respectively. Antibiotic resistance genes 
were highest in the manure and water samples followed by tilapia feces and 
lowest in catfish feces (p < 0.0001). In this study, we demonstrate how the 
bacterial and eukaryotic microbial composition of fish ponds are influenced by 
specific livestock manure inputs and that the gut microbiome of tilapia is more 
sensitive and responsive than catfish to these changes. We conclude that animal 
manure used as fertilizer induces a primarily prebiotic effect on the pond 
ecosystem rather than a direct probiotic effect on fish.

Spontaneous alcoholic fermentation of grape must is a complex process, carried 
out by indigenous yeast populations arising from the vineyard or the winery 
environment and therefore representing an autochthonous microbial terroir of the 
production area. Microbial diversity at species and biotype level is extremely 
important in order to develop the composite and typical flavour profile of DOCG 
(Appellation of Controlled and Guaranteed Origin) wines. In this study, we 
monitored fungal populations involved in spontaneous fermentations of Aglianico 
and Greco di Tufo grape must by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 18S rRNA 
gene amplicons. We firstly proposed an alternative/addition to ITS as target 
gene in HTS studies and highlighted consistency between the culture-dependent 
and -independent approaches. A complex mycobiota was found at the beginning of 
the fermentation, mainly characterized by non-Saccharomyces yeasts and several 
moulds, with differences between the two types of grapes. Moreover, Interdelta 
patterns revealed a succession of several Saccharomyces cerevisiae biotypes and 
a high genetic diversity within this species.

Marine infrastructure can favor the spread of non-indigenous marine biofouling 
species by providing a suitable habitat for them to proliferate. Cryptic 
organisms or those in early life stages can be difficult to distinguish by 
conventional morphological taxonomy. Molecular tools, such as metabarcoding, may 
improve their detection. In this study, the ability of morpho-taxonomy and 
metabarcoding (18S rRNA and COI) using three reference databases (PR2, BOLD and 
NCBI) to characterize biodiversity and detect non-indigenous species (NIS) in 
biofouling was compared on 60 passive samplers deployed over summer and winter 
in a New Zealand marina. Highest resolution of metazoan taxa was identified 
using 18S rRNA assigned to PR2. There were higher assignment rates to NCBI 
reference sequences, but poorer taxonomic identification. Using all methods, 48 
potential NIS were identified. Metabarcoding detected the largest proportion of 
those NIS: 77% via 18S rRNA/PR2 and NCBI and 35% via COI/BOLD and NCBI. 
Morpho-taxonomy detected an additional 14% of all identified NIS comprising 
mainly of bryozoan taxa. The data highlight several on-going challenges, 
including: differential marker resolution, primer biases, incomplete sequence 
reference databases, and variations in bioinformatic pipelines. Combining 
morpho-taxonomy and molecular analysis methods will likely enhance the detection 
of NIS from complex biofouling.

Given the complexity of the airway microbiota in the respiratory tract of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) patients, it seems crucial to compile the most exhaustive and 
exact list of the microbial communities inhabiting CF airways. The aim of the 
present study was to compare the bacterial and fungal diversity of sputa from 
adult CF patients during non-exacerbation period by culture-based and molecular 
methods, and ultra-deep-sequencing (UDS). Sputum samples from four CF patients 
were cultured and analysed by DNA extractions followed by terminal restriction 
fragment length polymorphism analysis through resolution of bacterial ribosomal 
gene (rDNA) fragments, and cloning plus sequencing of part of fungal rRNA genes. 
These approaches were compared with UDS method targeting 16S rDNA gene and the 
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 region of rDNA. A total of 27 bacterial and 
18 fungal genera were detected from the four patients. Five (18%) and 3 (16%) 
genera were detected by culture for bacteria and fungi, respectively, 9 (33%) 
and 3 (16%) by first generation sequencing (FGS) methods, and 26 (96%) and 18 
(100%) by UDS. The mean number of genera detected by UDS per patient was 
statistically higher than by culture or FGS methods. Patients with severe airway 
disease as assessed by standard spirometry exhibited a reduced fungal and 
bacterial diversity. UDS approach evaluates more extensively the diversity of 
fungal and bacterial flora compared with cultures. However, it currently remains 
difficult to routinely use UDS mainly because of the lack of standardization, 
and the current cost of this method.

This study was aimed at identifying indigenous microorganisms from palm oil mill 
effluent (POME) and to ascertain the microbial load. Isolation and 
identification of indigenous microorganisms was subjected to standard 
microbiological methods and sequencing of the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. 
Sequencing of the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes for the microbial strains 
signifies that they were known as Micrococcus luteus 101PB, Stenotrophomonas 
maltophilia 102PB, Bacillus cereus 103PB, Providencia vermicola 104PB, 
Klebsiella pneumoniae 105PB, Bacillus subtilis 106PB, Aspergillus fumigatus 
107PF, Aspergillus nomius 108PF, Aspergillus niger 109PF and Meyerozyma 
guilliermondii 110PF. Results revealed that the population of total 
heterotrophic bacteria (THB) ranged from 9.5 × 105 - 7.9 × 106 cfu/mL. The total 
heterotrophic fungi (THF) ranged from 2.1 × 104 - 6.4 × 104 cfu/mL. Total viable 
heterotrophic indigenous microbial population on CMC agar ranged from 8.2 × 105 
- 9.1 × 106 cfu/mL and 1.4 × 103 - 3.4 × 103 cfu/mL for bacteria and fungi 
respectively. The microbial population of oil degrading bacteria (ODB) ranged 
from 6.4 × 105 - 4.8 × 106 cfu/mL and the oil degrading fungi (ODF) ranged from 
2.8 × 103 - 4.7 × 104 cfu/mL. The findings revealed that microorganisms flourish 
well in POME. Therefore, this denotes that isolating native microorganisms from 
POME is imperative for effectual bioremediation, biotreatment and biodegradation 
of industrial wastewaters.

Gut fungi may influence the course of Clostridium difficile infection either 
positively or negatively for the host. Fungi are not prominent in the mouse gut, 
and C. albicans, the major human gastrointestinal commensal yeast, is in low 
abundance or absent in mice. Bifidobacterium is one of the probiotics that may 
attenuate the severity of C. difficile infection. Inflammatory synergy between 
C. albicans and C. difficile, in gut, may provide a state that more closely 
resembles human infection and be more suitable for testing probiotic effects. We 
performed fecal mycobiota analysis and administered C. albicans at 1 day prior 
to C. difficile dosing. Fecal eukaryotic 18S rDNA analysis demonstrated the 
presence of Ascomycota, specifically, Candida spp., after oral antibiotics, 
despite negative fecal fungal culture. C. albicans administration enhanced the 
severity of the C. difficile infection model as determined by mortality rate, 
weight loss, gut leakage (FITC-dextran assay), and serum and intestinal tissue 
cytokines. This occurred without increased fecal C. difficile or bacteremia, in 
comparison with C. difficile gavage alone. Candida lysate with C. difficile 
increased IL-8 production from HT-29 and Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial 
cell-lines. Bifidobacterium attenuated the disease severity of the C. difficile 
plus Candida model. The reduced severity was associated with decreased Candida 
burdens in feces. In conclusion, gut C. albicans worsened C. difficile 
infection, possibly through exacerbation of inflammation. Hence, a mouse model 
of Clostridium difficile infection with C. albicans present in the gut may 
better model the human patient condition. Gut fungal mycobiome investigation in 
patients with C. difficile is warranted and may suggest therapeutic targets.

The human gut microbiota plays a major role in the development of colorectal 
cancer (CRC). Many studies have attempted to define links between microbiota 
residents, their function and disease development. We now have incredible 
molecular tools to allow us to study the gut microbiome however in order to make 
best use of these sophisticated approaches we need to ensure that samples are 
collected and processed using standardized and reproducible protocols. Here we 
provide an overview of molecular analysis methods and describe protocols for 
collecting and processing clinical samples for subsequent microbiome analysis.

The gut microbiome of lower termites comprises protists and bacteria that help 
these insects to digest cellulose and to thrive on wood. The composition of the 
termite gut microbiome correlates with phylogenetic distance of the animal host 
and host ecology (diet) in termites collected from their natural environment. 
However, carryover of transient microbes from host collection sites are an 
experimental concern and might contribute to the ecological imprints on the 
termite gut microbiome. Here, we set out to test whether an ecological imprint 
on the termite gut microbiome remains, when focusing on the persistent 
microbiome. Therefore, we kept five termite species under strictly controlled 
dietary conditions and subsequently profiled their protist and bacterial gut 
microbial communities using 18S and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The 
species differed in their ecology; while three of the investigated species were 
wood-dwellers that feed on the piece of wood they live in and never leave except 
for the mating flight, the other two species were foragers that regularly leave 
their nests to forage for food. Despite these prominent ecological differences, 
protist microbiome structure aligned with phylogenetic relatedness of termite 
host species. Conversely, bacterial communities seemed more flexible, suggesting 
that microbiome structure aligned more strongly with the foraging and 
wood-dwelling ecologies. Interestingly, protist and bacterial community 
alpha-diversity correlated, suggesting either putative interactions between 
protists and bacteria, or that both types of microbes in the termite gut follow 
shared structuring principles. Taken together, our results add to the notion 
that bacterial communities are more variable over evolutionary time than protist 
communities and might react more flexibly to changes in host ecology.

BACKGROUND: Due to a lack of systematic diagnostics, our understanding of the 
diversity and role of eukaryotic microbiota in human health is limited. While 
studies have shown fungal communities to be significant modulators of human 
health, information on the prevalence of taxa such as protozoa and helminths has 
been limited to a small number of species for which targeted molecular 
diagnostics are available. To probe the diversity of eukaryotic microbes and 
their relationships with other members of the microbiota, we applied in silico 
and experimental approaches to design a novel two-amplicon surveillance tool, 
based on sequencing regions of ribosomal RNA genes and their internal 
transcribed spacers. We subsequently demonstrated the utility of our approach by 
characterizing the eukaryotic microbiota of 46 hospitalized Malawian children 
suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM).
RESULTS: Through in silico analysis and validation on a diverse panel of 
eukaryotes, we identified 18S rRNA variable genetic regions 4 and 5 (18S V4 V5), 
together with a region encoding 28S rRNA variable genetic region 2 and the 
internal transcribed spacers (transITS), as optimal for the systematic 
classification of eukaryotes. Sequencing of these regions revealed protozoa in 
all stool samples from children with SAM and helminths in most, including 
several eukaryotes previously implicated in malnutrition and diarrheal disease. 
Clinical comparisons revealed no association between protozoan parasites and 
diarrhea or HIV reactivity. However, the presence of Blastocystis correlated 
with bacterial alpha diversity and increased abundance of specific taxa, 
including Sporobacter, Cellulosibacter, Oscillibacter, and Roseburia.
CONCLUSION: We suggest this novel two-amplicon based strategy will prove an

The rhizospheric microbiome is clearly affected by plant species and certain of 
their functional traits. These functional traits allow plants to adapt to their 
environmental conditions by acquiring or conserving nutrients, thus defining 
different ecological resource-use plant strategies. In the present study, we 
investigated whether plants with one of the two nutrient-use strategies 
(conservative versus exploitative) could influence fungal communities involved 
in soil organic matter degradation and root exudate assimilation, as well as 
those colonizing root tissues. We applied a DNA-based, stable-isotope probing 
(DNA-SIP) approach to four grass species distributed along a gradient of plant 
nutrient resource strategies, ranging from conservative to exploitative species, 
and analyzed their associated mycobiota composition using a fungal internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS) and Glomeromycotina 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding 
approach. Our results demonstrated that fungal taxa associated with exploitative 
and conservative plants could be separated into two general categories according 
to their location: generalists, which are broadly distributed among plants from 
each strategy and represent the core mycobiota of soil organic matter degraders, 
root exudate consumers in the root-adhering soil, and root colonizers; and 
specialists, which are locally abundant in one species and more specifically 
involved in soil organic matter degradation or root exudate assimilation on the 
root-adhering soil and the root tissues. Interestingly, for arbuscular 
mycorrhizal fungi analysis, all plant roots were mainly colonized by Glomus 
species, whereas an increased diversity of Glomeromycotina genera was observed 
for the exploitative plant species Dactylis glomerata.

In mammals, two factors likely to affect the diversity and composition of 
intestinal bacteria (bacterial microbiome) and eukaryotes (eukaryome) are social 
status and age. In species in which social status determines access to 
resources, socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health 
status than subordinates. As high species diversity is an index of ecosystem 
health, the intestinal biome of healthier, socially dominant animals should be 
more diverse than those of subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile 
intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles 
than adults. We tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age 
(juvenile/adult) and (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and 
eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a 
highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines 
access to resources. We comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually 
known adult females and 7 juveniles in the Serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and 
eukaryotes, using a set of 48 different amplicons (4 for bacterial 16S, 44 for 
eukaryote 18S) in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach. We compared sequence 
abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa 
detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads significantly 
predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted, underscoring the value of an 
amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load. In 
line with our predictions, our results revealed a significantly less diverse 
microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of 
eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals. We propose that 
free-ranging wildlife can provide an intriguing model system to assess the 
adaptive value of intestinal biome diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes.

Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is a marine foundation species essential for coastal 
ecosystem services around the northern hemisphere. Like all macroscopic 
organisms, it possesses a microbiome (here defined as an associated prokaryotic 
community) which may play critical roles in modulating the interaction of 
eelgrass with its environment. For example, its leaf surface microbiome could 
inhibit or attract eukaryotic epibionts which may overgrow the eelgrass leading 
to reduced primary productivity and subsequent eelgrass meadow decline. We used 
amplicon sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes 
to assess the leaf surface microbiome (prokaryotes) as well as eukaryotic 
epibionts in- and outside lagoons on the German Baltic Sea coast. Prokaryote 
microbiomes varied substantially both between sites inside lagoons and between 
open coastal and lagoon sites. Water depth, leaf area and biofilm chlorophyll a 
concentration explained a large amount of variation in both prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic community composition. The prokaryotic microbiome and eukaryotic 
epibiont communities were highly correlated, and network analysis revealed 
disproportionate co-occurrence between a limited number of eukaryotic taxa and 
several bacterial taxa. This suggests that eelgrass leaf surfaces are home to a 
mosaic of microbiomes of several epibiotic eukaryotes, in addition to the 
microbiome of the eelgrass itself. Our findings thereby underline that 
eukaryotic diversity should be taken into account in order to explain 
prokaryotic microbiome assembly and dynamics in aquatic environments.

Constructed wetlands (CWs) have emerged as a promising technology for the 
purification of micro-polluted water. However, their nitrogen removal 
performance can be significantly degraded by design, operational, and 
environmental factors. The present study investigates the effects of ofloxacin 
(OFL: 0.1, 10, and 1000 μg L-1) and plants (Cyperus alternifolius L. and Typha 
angustifolia L.) on nitrogen removal in a micro-polluted CW system over a 
duration of 12 weeks. The effects were evaluated by investigating NH4-N and 
NO3-N removal efficiency, nitrification genes (amoA-AOA and amoA-AOB), 
denitrification genes (nirK and nirS), fungal 18S rRNA gene and microorganism 
community structure. The results showed that in unplanted CWs, OFL increased the 
NH4-N removal efficiency (from 72.6% to 80.7-82.1%), the abundances of amoA-AOA, 
nirS, nirK and fungal 18S rRNA gene, and the bacterial diversity but decreased 
the abundance of both amoA-AOB and bacterial richness. In contrast, both the 
nitrogen removal efficiency (83.4-89.5% for NH4-N and 33.8-38.5% for NO3-N) and 
bacterial diversity/richness were not significantly affected by OFL in planted 
CWs. In planted systems, OFL increased the relative abundance of Arthrobacter, 
Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus, which are proven antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 
This study showed that CWs are able to remove nitrogen from 
antibiotic-contaminated micro-polluted water, which might primarily be 
attributed to the presence of plants that protect the microorganism community.

Benthic microbial ecosystems are widespread yet knowledge gaps still remain on 
the relationships between the diversity of species across kingdoms and 
productivity. Here, we ask two fundamental questions: (i) How does species 
diversity relate to the rates of primary and heterotrophic productivity? (ii) 
How do diel variations in light-energy inputs influence productivity and 
microbiome diversity? To answer these questions, microbial mats from a magnesium 
sulfate hypersaline lake were used to establish microcosms. Both the number and 
relatedness between bacterial and eukaryotic taxa in the microbiome were assayed 
via amplicon-based sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes over two diel cycles. 
These results correlated with biomass productivity obtained from 
substrate-specific 13C stable isotope tracers that enabled comparisons between 
primary and heterotrophic productivity. Both bacterial and eukaryotic species 
richness and evenness were related only to the rates of 13C-labeled glucose and 
acetate biomass incorporation. Interestingly, measures of these heterotrophic 
relationships changed from positive and negative correlations depending on 
carbon derived from glucose or acetate, respectively. The bacterial and 
eukaryotic diversity of this ecosystem is also controlled, in part, from energy 
constraints imposed by changing irradiance over a diel cycle.

Rhizosphere microbial community composition can be influenced by different 
biotic and abiotic factors. We investigated the composition and co-variation of 
rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities from two sorghum genotypes (BRS330 
and SRN-39) in three different plant growth stages (emergence of the second 
leaf, (day10), vegetative to reproductive differentiation point (day 35), and at 
the last visible emerged leaf (day 50)) in two different soil types, Clue field 
(CF) and Vredepeel (VD). We observed that either bacterial or fungal community 
had its composition stronger influenced by soil followed by plant growth stage 
and cultivar. However, the influence of plant growth stage was higher on fungal 
community composition than on the bacterial community composition. Furthermore, 
we showed that sorghum rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities can affect 
each other's composition and structure. The decrease in relative abundance of 
the fungus genus Gibberella over plant growth stages was followed by decrease of 
the bacterial families Oxalobacteracea and Sphingobacteriacea. Although cultivar 
effect was not the major responsible for bacterial and fungal community 
composition, cultivar SRN-39 showed to promote a stronger co-variance between 
bacterial and fungal communities.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing or metagenomic whole genome sequencing is a 
genome-wide sequencing approach to explore bacterial communities directly from 
their habitat or sites of infection. However, host DNA contamination in 
metagenomic sequencing overwhelm low biomass of microbial signals and decrease 
sensitivity for microbial detection. In this study, we evaluated the host DNA 
depletion efficiency of four different microbiome DNA enrichment methods 
(NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment kit, Molzym Ultra-Deep Microbiome Prep, 
QIAamp DNA Microbiome kit and Zymo HostZERO microbial DNA kit) in diabetic foot 
infection (DFI) tissue samples using quantitative real-time PCR and their effect 
on bacterial community composition by 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. The 
host DNA depletion ratio (18S/16S rRNA), the percentage of bacterial DNA 
component and the microbial community profile of DFI were compared before 
(control) and after each microbiome DNA enrichment method. There was a 
significant difference in the 18S/16S rRNA ratio among different microbiome DNA 
enrichment methods (p <.001). QIAamp and HostZERO method reduced 18S/16S rRNA 
ratio by 32 and 57 fold than control method respectively. The percentage of 
bacterial DNA component increased more than ten-fold in QiaAmp (71.0 ± 2.7%) and 
HostZERO (79.9 ± 3.1%) method respectively than those in control method without 
host DNA depletion (6.7 ± 0.1%). It demonstrated the host DNA contamination was 
efficiently depleted and bacterial DNA was effectively enriched in HostZERO and 
QIAamp methods, attesting to the efficacy of these two methods in shotgun 
metagenomic sequencing studies. Overall, bacterial community composition of DFI 
samples was similar between control and microbiome enriched DNA samples.

Plant root-associated microbial symbionts comprise the plant rhizobiome. These 
microbes function in provisioning nutrients and water to their hosts, impacting 
plant health and disease. The plant microbiome is shaped by plant species, plant 
genotype, soil and environmental conditions, but the contributions of these 
variables are hard to disentangle from each other in natural systems. We used 
bioassay common garden experiments to decouple plant genotype and soil property 
impacts on fungal and bacterial community structure in the Populus rhizobiome. 
High throughput amplification and sequencing of 16S, ITS, 28S and 18S rDNA was 
accomplished through 454 pyrosequencing. Co-association patterns of fungal and 
bacterial taxa were assessed with 16S and ITS datasets. Community bipartite 
fungal-bacterial networks and PERMANOVA results attribute significant difference 
in fungal or bacterial communities to soil origin, soil chemical properties and 
plant genotype. Indicator species analysis identified a common set of root 
bacteria as well as endophytic and ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Populus 
in different soils. However, no single taxon, or consortium of microbes, was 
indicative of a particular Populus genotype. Fungal-bacterial networks were 
over-represented in arbuscular mycorrhizal, endophytic, and ectomycorrhizal 
fungi, as well as bacteria belonging to the orders Rhizobiales, Chitinophagales, 
Cytophagales, and Burkholderiales. These results demonstrate the importance of 
soil and plant genotype on fungal-bacterial networks in the belowground plant 
microbiome.

Studies of host-associated microbes are critical for advancing our understanding 
of ecology and evolution across diverse taxa and ecosystems. Nematode worms are 
ubiquitous across most habitats on earth, yet little is known about 
host-associated microbial assemblages within the phylum. Free-living nematodes 
are globally abundant and diverse in marine sediments, with species exhibiting 
distinct buccal cavity (mouth) morphologies that are thought to play an 
important role in feeding ecology and life history strategies. Here, we 
investigated patterns in marine nematode microbiomes, by characterizing 
host-associated microbial taxa in 281 worms isolated from a range of habitat 
types (deep-sea, shallow water, methane seeps, Lophelia coral mounds, kelp 
holdfasts) across three distinct geographic regions (Arctic, Southern California 
and Gulf of Mexico). Microbiome profiles were generated from single worms 
spanning 33 distinct morphological genera, using a two-gene metabarcoding 
approach to amplify the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene targeting 
bacteria/archaea and the V1-V2 region of the 18S rRNA gene targeting microbial 
eukaryotes. Contrary to our expectations, nematode microbiome profiles 
demonstrated no distinct patterns either globally (across depths and ocean 
basins) or locally (within site); prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial 
assemblages did not correlate with nematode feeding morphology, host phylogeny 
or morphological identity, ocean region or marine habitat type. However, 
fine-scale analysis of nematode microbiomes revealed a variety of novel 
ecological interactions, including putative parasites and symbionts, and 
potential associations with bacterial/archaeal taxa involved in nitrogen and 
methane cycling. Our results suggest that in marine habitats, free-living 
nematodes may utilize diverse and generalist foraging strategies that are not 
correlated with host genotype or feeding morphology. Furthermore, some abiotic 
factors such as geographic region and habitat type do not appear to play an 
obvious role in structuring host-microbe associations or feeding preferences.

The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies has deepened our 
understanding of complex microbial communities and greatly facilitated the study 
of as-yet uncultured microbes and viruses. Studies of complex microbial 
communities require high-quality data to generate valid results. Here, we detail 
current methods of microbial and viral community sample acquisition, DNA 
extraction, sample preparation, and sequencing on Illumina high-throughput 
platforms. While using appropriate analytical tools is important, it must not 
overshadow the need for establishing a proper experimental design and obtaining 
sufficient numbers of samples for statistical purposes. Researchers must also 
take care to sample biologically relevant sites and control for potential 
confounding factors (e.g., contamination).

Recently, genetic approaches have revealed a surprising bacterial world as well 
as a growing knowledge of the enormous distribution of animal-bacterial 
interactions. In the present study, the diversity of the microorganisms 
associated to the hydroid Aglaophenia octodonta was studied with 
epifluorescence, optical, and scanning electron microscopy. Small subunit 
ribosomal RNA gene sequencing with "universal" and taxon-specific primers 
allowed the assignment of the microalgae to Symbiodinium and the peritrich 
ciliates to Pseudovorticella, while the luminous vibrios were identified as 
Vibrio jasicida of the Harvey clade. To understand the possible relationships 
among Vibrio jasicida, Symbiodinium, A. octodonta, and Pseudovorticella, 
specific treatments were conducted in microcosm experiments, with the antibiotic 
ampicillin and other substances that interfere with bacterial and hydroid 
metabolism. Treatment of A. octodonta with ampicillin resulted in a decrease of 
bacterial luminescence followed by Pseudovorticella detachment and Symbiodinium 
expulsion and suggesting that these microorganisms form a "consortium" with 
beneficial metabolic interdependence. This hypothesis was reinforced by the 
evidence that low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, which stimulate the 
bacterial oxidative metabolism and luminescence by releasing oxygen, were able 
to counteract the detrimental effect of ampicillin on the stability of the 
studied A. octodonta association. A model is proposed in which microalgae that 
release oxygen during photosynthesis are useful to luminous bacteria for their 
metabolism and for establishing/maintaining symbiosis leading to a close 
alliance and mutual benefit of the system A. octodonta-Vibrio 
jasicida-Pseudovorticella sp.-Symbiodinium sp.

The aim of this study was to understand the spatial distribution of microbial 
communities (18S and 16S rRNA genes) across one of the harshest terrestrial 
landscapes on Earth. We carried out Illumina sequencing using samples from two 
expeditions to the high slopes (up to 6050 m.a.s.l.) of Volcán Socompa and 
Llullaillaco to describe the microbial communities associated with the extremely 
dry tephra compared to areas that receive water from fumaroles and ice fields 
made up of nieves penitentes. There were strong spatial patterns relative to 
these landscape features with the most diverse (alpha diversity) communities 
being associated with fumaroles. Penitentes did not significantly increase alpha 
diversity compared to dry tephra at the same elevation (5825 m.a.s.l.) on Volcán 
Socompa, but the structure of the 18S community (beta diversity) was 
significantly affected by the presence of penitentes on both Socompa and 
Llullaillaco. In addition, the 18S community was significantly different in 
tephra wetted by penitentes versus dry tephra sites across many elevations on 
Llullaillaco. Traditional phototrophs (algae and cyanobacteria) were abundant in 
wetter tephra associated with fumaroles, and algae (but not cyanobacteria) were 
common in tephra associated with penitentes. Dry tephra had neither algae nor 
cyanobacteria but did host potential phototrophs in the Rhodospirillales on 
Volcán Llullaillaco, but not on Socompa. These results provide new insights into 
the distribution of microbes across one of the most extreme terrestrial 
environments on Earth and provide the first ever glimpse of life associated with 
nieves penitentes, spire-shaped ice structures that are widespread across the 
mostly unexplored high-elevation Andean Central Volcanic Zone.

Systems with strong horizontal and vertical gradients, such as fjords, are 
useful models for studying environmental forcing. Here we examine microbial 
(prokaryotic and eukaryotic) community changes associated with the surface low 
salinity layer (LSL) and underlying seawater in multiple fjords in Fiordland 
National Park (New Zealand). High rainfall (1200-8000 mm annually) and linked 
runoff from native forested catchments results in surface LSLs with high tannin 
concentrations within each fjord. These gradients are expected to drive changes 
in microbial communities. We used amplicon sequencing (16S and 18S) to assess 
the impact of these gradients on microbial communities and identified depth 
linked changes in diversity and community structure. With increasing depth, we 
observed significant increases in Proteobacteria (15%) and SAR (37%), decreases 
in Opisthokonta (35%), and transiently increased Bacteroidetes (3% increase from 
0 to 40 m, decreasing by 8% at 200 m). Community structure differences were 
observed along a transect from the head to the mouth, specifically 25% mean 
relative abundance decreases in Opisthokonta and Bacteroidetes, and increases in 
SAR (25%) and Proteobacteria (>5%) at the surface, indicating changes based on 
distance from the ocean. This provides the first in-depth view into the 
ecological drivers of microbial communities within New Zealand fjords.

Fungi are the key players in ecosystems as well as in plant and human health. 
High-throughput molecular identification of fungi has greatly progressed our 
understanding about the diversity of mutualists, saprotrophs, and pathogens. We 
argue that the methods promoted by the microbiome consortia are suboptimal for 
detection of the most important fungal pathogens and ecologically important 
degraders. We recommend several sets of optimized primers for analysis of fungi 
or all eukaryote groups based on either short or long amplicons that cover the 
ITS region as well as part of 18S and 28S rDNA.

Abies nordmanniana is a major Christmas tree species in Europe, but their uneven 
and prolonged growth slows down their production. By a 16S and 18S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing approach, we performed a characterization of root-associated 
bacterial and fungal communities for three-year-old A. nordmanniana plants 
collected from two nurseries in Denmark and Germany and displaying different 
growth patterns (small versus tall plants). Proteobacteria had the highest 
relative abundance at both sampling sites and plant sizes, and Ascomycota was 
the most abundant fungal phylum. At the order level, Acidobacteriales, 
Actinomycetales, Burkholderiales, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales represented 
the bacterial core microbiome of A. nordmanniana, independently of the sampling 
site or plant size, while the fungal core microbiome included members of the 
Agaricales, Hypocreales, and Pezizales. Principal Coordinate Analysis indicated 
that both bacterial and fungal communities clustered according to the sampling 
site pointing to the significance of soil characteristics and climatic 
conditions for the composition of root-associated microbial communities. Major 
differences between communities from tall and small plants were a dominance of 
the potential pathogen Fusarium (Hypocreales) in the small plants from Germany, 
while Agaricales, that includes reported beneficial ectomycorrhizal fungi, 
dominated in the tall plants. An evaluation of plant root antioxidative enzyme 
profiles showed higher levels of the antioxidative enzymes ascorbate peroxidase, 
peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase in small plants compared to tall plants. We 
suggest that the higher antioxidative enzyme activities combined with the growth 
arrest phenotype indicate higher oxidative stress levels in the small plants. 
Additionally, the correlations between the relative abundances of specific taxa 
of the microbiome with the plant antioxidative enzyme profiles were established. 
The main result was that many more bacterial taxa correlated positively than 
negatively with one or more antioxidative enzyme activity. This may suggest that 
the ability of bacteria to increase plant antioxidative enzyme defenses is 
widespread.

Control of common scab disease can be reached by resistant cultivars or 
suppressive soils. Both mechanisms are likely to translate into particular 
potato microbiome profiles, but the relative importance of each is not known. 
Here, microbiomes of bulk and tuberosphere soil and of potato periderm were 
studied in one resistant and one susceptible cultivar grown in a conducive and a 
suppressive field. Disease severity was suppressed similarly by both means yet, 
the copy numbers of txtB gene (coding for a pathogenicity determinant) were 
similar in both soils but higher in periderms of the susceptible cultivar from 
conducive soil. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes for bacteria (completed by 
16S rRNA microarray approach) and archaea, and of 18S rRNA genes for 
micro-eukarytes showed that in bacteria, the more important was the effect of 
cultivar and diversity decreased from resistant cultivar to bulk soil to 
susceptible cultivar. The major changes occurred in proportions of 
Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria. In archaea and 
micro-eukaryotes, differences were primarily due to the suppressive and 
conducive soil. The effect of soil suppressiveness × cultivar resistance 
depended on the microbial community considered, but differed also with respect 
to soil and plant nutrient contents particularly in N, S and Fe.

Prepartum and postpartum rumen fluid microbiomes: characterization and 
correlation with production traits in dairy cows.

Microbes present in the rumen of dairy cows are essential for degradation of 
cellulosic and nonstructural carbohydrates of plant origin. The prepartum and 
postpartum diets of high-producing dairy cows are substantially different, but 
in what ways the rumen microbiome changes in response and how those changes may 
influence production traits are not well elucidated. Here, we sequenced the 16S 
and 18S rRNA genes using the MiSeq platform to characterize the prepartum and 
postpartum rumen fluid microbiomes in 115 high-producing dairy cows, including 
both primiparous and multiparous animals. Discriminant analysis identified 
differences between the microbiomes of prepartum and postpartum samples and 
between primiparous and multiparous cows. 18S rRNA sequencing revealed an 
overwhelming dominance of the protozoan class Litostomatea, with over 90% of the 
eukaryotic microbial population belonging to that group. Additionally, fungi 
were relatively more prevalent and Litostomatea relatively less prevalent in 
prepartum samples than in postpartum ones. The core rumen microbiome (common to 
all samples) consisted of 64 bacterial taxa, of which members of the genus 
Prevotella were the most prevalent. The Chao1 richness index was greater for 
prepartum multiparous cows than for postpartum multiparous cows. Multivariable 
models identified bacterial taxa associated with increased or reduced milk 
production, and general linear models revealed that a metagenomically based 
prediction of productivity is highly associated with production of actual milk 
and milk components. In conclusion, the structure of the rumen fluid microbiome 
shifts between the prepartum and first-week postpartum periods, and its profile 
within the context of this study could be used to accurately predict production 
traits.

The plant microbiome, composed of diverse interacting microorganisms, is thought 
to undergird host integrity and well-being. Though it is well understood that 
environmental perturbations like oil pollution can alter the diversity and 
composition of microbiomes, remarkably little is known about how disturbance 
alters plant-fungal associations. Using Next-Generation sequencing of the 18S 
rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) region, we examined outcomes of enduring 
oil exposure on aboveground leaf and belowground endophytic root and rhizosphere 
fungal communities of Spartina alterniflora, a highly valued ecosystem engineer 
in southeastern Louisiana marshes affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon 
accident. We found that aboveground foliar fungal communities exhibited 
site-dependent compositional turnover with consequent loss in diversity 
according to oiling history. Rhizosphere soil communities also exhibited shifts 
in community composition associated with oiling history, whereas root endophytic 
communities did not. Oiling did not increase or decrease similarities among 
aboveground and belowground communities within an individual host, indicating 
that host plant characteristics exert stronger control than external factors on 
fungal community composition. These results show that fungal community responses 
to oiling vary within tissues of the same host plant, and that differences in 
the local environment, or alternatively, site-specific differences in residual 
oil constrain the magnitude of exposure responses. Our study offers novel 
perspectives on how environmental contaminants and perturbations can influence 
plant microbiomes, highlighting the importance of assessing long-term ecological 
outcomes of oil pollution to better understand how shifts in microbial 
communities influence plant performance and ecosystem function. Our findings are 
relevant to coastal management programs tasked with responding to oil spills and 
increasing pressures arising from intensifying development and climate change. 
Understanding how modification of plant-microbiome associations influences plant 
performance, particularly of ecosystem engineers like S. alterniflora, can help 
guide efforts to protect and restore at-risk coastal ecosystems.

While harmful algal blooms caused by the ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate, 
Cochlodinium (Margalefidinium) polykrikoides, are allelopathic and may have 
unique associations with bacteria, a comprehensive assessment of the planktonic 
communities associated with these blooms has been lacking. Here, we used 
high-throughput amplicon sequencing to assess size fractionated (0.2 and 5 μm) 
bacterial (16S) and phytoplankton assemblages (18S) associated with blooms of C. 
polykrikoides during recurrent blooms in NY, USA. Over a three-year period, 
samples were collected inside ('patch') and outside ('non-patch') dense 
accumulations of C. polykrikoides to assess the microbiome associated with these 
blooms. Eukaryotic plankton communities of blooms had significantly lower 
diversity than non-bloom samples, and non-bloom samples hosted 30 eukaryotic 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) not found within blooms, suggesting they may 
have been allelopathically excluded from blooms. Differential abundance analyses 
revealed that C. polykrikoides blooms were significantly enriched in 
dinoflagellates (p<0.001) and the experimental enrichment of C. polykrikoides 
led to a significant increase in the relative abundance of eight genera of 
dinoflagellates but a significant decline in other eukaryotic plankton. 
Amoebophrya co-dominated both within- and near- C. polykrikoides blooms and was 
more abundant in bloom patches. The core bacterial microbiome of the >0.2μm 
fraction of blooms was dominated by an uncultured bacterium from the SAR11 
clade, while the >5μm size fraction was co-dominated by an uncultured bacterium 
from Rhodobacteraceae and Coraliomargarita. Two bacterial lineages within the 
>0.2μm fraction, as well as the Gammaproteobacterium, Halioglobus, from the >5μm 
fraction were unique to the microbiome of blooms, while there were 154 bacterial 
OTUs only found in non-bloom waters. Collectively, these findings reveal the 
unique composition and potential function of eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
communities associated with C. polykrikoides blooms.

Technosols can be used to rehabilitate degraded land and reuse wastes. Ideally, 
these newly formed soils should also fulfil the main soil functions. In this 
study, initially, we characterized the physicochemical and microbial properties 
of different formulations and their ingredients (i.e., dirt from a waste 
recovery plant, recycled bentonite, sewage sludge). When these technosols were 
then used for the rehabilitation of a quarry, the evolution of such properties 
was monitored for three consecutive years. Physicochemical and microbial 
properties were compared to those of a reference soil from a nearby forest. 
Diversity and composition of prokaryotes and eukaryotes were determined using 
16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Three years after establishment, as much 
as 78.8% and 63.9% of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic orders, respectively, were 
shared between the technosols and the reference forest soil. Although technosols 
initially showed lower values of CO2 emission, compaction and functional 
diversity (Biolog EcoPlates™), at the end of the study these values were similar 
to those observed in the reference forest soil. It was concluded that the 
microbiota of the studied technosols resembles that of the nearby forest soil 
after just three years of establishment.

The present study aimed to reveal the eukaryotic diets of two economically 
important marine sediment-inhabiting worms, Sipunculus nudus (peanut worm) and 
Urechis unicinctus (spoon worm), using clone libraries and phylogenetic analyses 
of 18S rRNA genes. Fungal rDNA was also targeted and analyzed to reveal 
mycobiomes. Overall, we detected a wide range of eukaryotic phylotypes 
associated with the larvae of S. nudus and in the gut contents of both worms. 
These phylotypes included ciliates, diatoms, dinoflagellates, eustigmatophytes, 
placidids, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes, flatworms, seaweeds, and higher plants. 
Oomycetes were associated with the planktonic larvae of S. nudus. The 
composition of eukaryotic diets shifted greatly across the larval, juvenile, and 
adult stages of S. nudus, and among different gut sections in U. unicinctus, 
reflecting lifestyle changes during the ontogeny of the peanut worm and 
progressive digestion in the spoon worm. Malassezia-like fungi were prevalent in 
mycobiomes. Epicoccum and Trichosporon-related phylotypes dominated mycobiomes 
associated with larval individuals and in the gut contents of adults, 
respectively. The gut mycobiome of S. nudus was successively characterized 
through the midgut, aspiratory intestines, hindgut, and rectum as having a high 
proportion of Climacodon-Rhizochaete, Ceriporiopsis, 
Cladosporium-Pseudomicrostroma, and Malassezia-related species in the libraries. 
These results emphasize the dynamics of diets and gut mycobiomes in marine 
benthic animals.

Inoculation of plants with beneficial plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) 
emerges a valuable strategy for ecosystem recovery. However, drought conditions 
might compromise plant-microbe interactions especially in semiarid regions. This 
study highlights the effect of native PGPB after 1 year inoculation on 
autochthonous shrubs growth and rhizosphere microbial community composition and 
activity under drought stress conditions. We inoculated three plant species of 
semiarid Mediterranean zones, Thymus vulgaris, Santolina chamaecyparissus and 
Lavandula dentata with a Bacillus thuringiensis strain IAM 12077 and evaluated 
the impact on plant biomass, plant nutrient contents, arbuscular mycorrhiza 
fungi (AMF) colonization, soil rhizosphere microbial activity and both the 
bacterial and fungal communities. Inoculation with strain IAM 12077 improved the 
ability of all three plants species to uptake nutrients from the soil, promoted 
L. dentata shoot growth (>65.8%), and doubled the AMF root colonization of S. 
chamaecyparissus. Inoculation did not change the rhizosphere microbial 
community. Moreover, changes in rhizosphere microbial activity were mainly plant 
species-specific and strongly associated with plant nutrients. In conclusion, 
the strain IAM 12077 induced positive effects on plant growth and nutrient 
acquisition with no impact on the rhizosphere microbiome, indicating a 
rhizosphere microbial community resilient to native bacteria inoculation.

An inherent issue in high-throughput rRNA gene tag sequencing microbiome surveys 
is that they provide compositional data in relative abundances. This often leads 
to spurious correlations, making the interpretation of relationships to 
biogeochemical rates challenging. To overcome this issue, we quantitatively 
estimated the abundance of microorganisms by spiking in known amounts of 
internal DNA standards. Using a 3-year sample set of diverse microbial 
communities from the Western Antarctica Peninsula, we demonstrated that the 
internal standard method yielded community profiles and taxon cooccurrence 
patterns substantially different from those derived using relative abundances. 
We found that the method provided results consistent with the traditional 
CHEMTAX analysis of pigments and total bacterial counts by flow cytometry. Using 
the internal standard method, we also showed that chloroplast 16S rRNA gene data 
in microbial surveys can be used to estimate abundances of certain eukaryotic 
phototrophs such as cryptophytes and diatoms. In Phaeocystis, scatter in the 
16S/18S rRNA gene ratio may be explained by physiological adaptation to 
environmental conditions. We conclude that the internal standard method, when 
applied to rRNA gene microbial community profiling, is quantitative and that its 
application will substantially improve our understanding of microbial 
ecosystems.IMPORTANCE High-throughput-sequencing-based marine microbiome 
profiling is rapidly expanding and changing how we study the oceans. Although 
powerful, the technique is not fully quantitative; it provides taxon counts only 
in relative abundances. In order to address this issue, we present a method to 
quantitatively estimate microbial abundances per unit volume of seawater 
filtered by spiking known amounts of internal DNA standards into each sample. We 
validated this method by comparing the calculated abundances to other 
independent estimates, including chemical markers (pigments) and total bacterial 
cell counts by flow cytometry. The internal standard approach allows us to 
quantitatively estimate and compare marine microbial community profiles, with 
important implications for linking environmental microbiomes to quantitative 
processes such as metabolic and biogeochemical rates.

Use of organic amendments is a valuable strategy for crop production. However, 
it remains unclear how organic amendments shape both soil microbial community 
structure and activity, and how these changes impact nutrient mineralization 
rates. We evaluated the effect of various organic amendments, which range in 
Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio and degradability, on the soil microbiome in a 
mesocosm study at 32, 69 and 132 days. Soil samples were collected to determine 
community structure (assessed by 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences), microbial 
biomass (fungi and bacteria), microbial activity (leucine incorporation and 
active hyphal length), and carbon and nitrogen mineralization rates. We 
considered the microbial soil DNA as the microbial seedbank. High C/N ratio 
favored fungal presence, while low C/N favored dominance of bacterial 
populations. Our results suggest that organic amendments shape the soil 
microbial community structure through a feedback mechanism by which microbial 
activity responds to changing organic inputs and rearranges composition of the 
microbial seedbank. We hypothesize that the microbial seedbank composition 
responds to changing organic inputs according to the resistance and resilience 
of individual species, while changes in microbial activity may result in 
increases or decreases in availability of various soil nutrients that affect 
plant nutrient uptake.

Although protists occupy a vast range of habitats and are known to interact with 
plants among other things via disease suppression, competition or growth 
stimulation, their contributions to the 'phytobiome' are not well described. To 
contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the plant holobiont, we examined 
cercozoan and oomycete taxa living in association with the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana grown in two different soils. Soil, roots, leaves and 
wooden toothpicks were analysed before and after surface sterilization. Cercozoa 
were identified using 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding, whereas the Internal 
Transcribed Spacer 1 was used to determine oomycetes. Subsequent analyses 
revealed strong spatial structuring of protist communities between compartments, 
although oomycetes appeared more specialized than Cercozoa. With regards to 
oomycetes, only members of the Peronosporales and taxa belonging to the genus 
Globisporangium were identified as shared members of the A. thaliana microbiome. 
This also applied to cercozoan taxa belonging to the Glissomonadida and 
Cercomonadida. We identified a strong influence by edaphic factors on the 
rhizosphere, but not for the phyllosphere. Distinct differences of Cercozoa 
found preferably in wood or fresh plant material imply specific niche 
adaptations. Our results highlight the importance of micro-eukaryotes for the 
plant holobiont.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts were enumerated and identified from 
naturally fermented buttermilk. Isolates were first subjected to chemical tests 
and then to molecular characterization. Molecular identification involved pure 
sequencing of 16s rRNA (LAB) and 18s rRNA (yeast) genes. Polymerase Chain 
Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) was used for detection 
of microbiota composition. Eighty-five LAB and 26 yeast isolates obtained from 
16 small-scale dairy farms were isolated and identified. The microbial 
composition was dominated by strains of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, 
Lactobacillus plantarum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Molecular techniques 
enabled not only genetic confirmation but also detection of some uncultivated 
strains. The presence of diverse strains of LAB and yeasts in NFB indicated a 
potential for development of different starter cultures to make new dairy 
products.

Conventional water resources are not sufficient in many regions to meet the 
needs of growing populations. Due to cyclical weather cycles, drought, and 
climate change, water stress has increased worldwide including in Southern 
California, which serves as a model for regions that integrate reuse of 
wastewater for both potable and non-potable use. The Orange County Water 
District (OCWD) Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) is a highly 
engineered system designed to treat and produce up to 100 million gallons per 
day (MGD) of purified water from a municipal wastewater source for potable 
reuse. Routine facility microbial water quality analysis is limited to standard 
indicators at this and similar facilities. Given recent advances in high 
throughput DNA sequencing techniques, complete microbial profiling of 
communities in water samples is now possible. By using 16S/18S rRNA gene 
sequencing, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing coupled to a highly 
accurate identification method along with 16S rRNA gene qPCR, we describe a 
detailed view of the total microbial community throughout the facility. The 
total bacterial load of the water at stages of the treatment train ranged from 
3.02 × 106 copies in source, unchlorinated wastewater feed to 5.49 × 101 copies 
of 16S rRNA gene/mL after treatment (consisting of microfiltration, reverse 
osmosis, and ultraviolet/advanced oxidation). Microbial diversity and load 
decreased by several orders of magnitude after microfiltration and reverse 
osmosis treatment, falling to almost non-detectable levels that more closely 
resembled controls of molecular grade laboratory water than the biomass detected 
in the source water. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes and viruses was 
also greatly reduced. Overall, system design performance was achieved, and 
comprehensive microbial community analysis was found to enable a more complete 
characterization of the water/wastewater microbial signature.

The application of metabarcoding to study animal-associated microeukaryotes has 
been restricted because the universal barcode used to study microeukaryotic 
ecology and distribution in the environment, the Small Subunit of the Ribosomal 
RNA gene (18S rRNA), is also present in the host. As a result, when 
host-associated microbial eukaryotes are analysed by metabarcoding, the reads 
tend to be dominated by host sequences. We have done an in silico validation 
against the SILVA 18S rRNA database of a non-metazoan primer set (primers that 
are biased against the metazoan 18S rRNA) that recovers only 2.6% of all the 
metazoan sequences, while recovering most of the other eukaryotes (80.4%). Among 
metazoans, the non-metazoan primers are predicted to amplify 74% of Porifera 
sequences, 4% of Ctenophora, and 15% of Cnidaria, while amplifying almost no 
sequences within Bilateria. In vivo, these non-metazoan primers reduce 
significantly the animal signal from coral and human samples, and when compared 
against universal primers provide at worst a 2-fold decrease in the number of 
metazoan reads and at best a 2800-fold decrease. This easy, inexpensive, and 
near-universal method for the study of animal-associated microeukaryotes 
diversity will contribute to a better understanding of the microbiome.

Plants modulate the soil microbiota by root exudation assembling a complex 
rhizosphere microbiome with organisms spanning different trophic levels. Here, 
we assessed the diversity of bacterial, fungal and cercozoan communities in 
landraces and modern varieties of wheat. The dominant taxa within each group 
were the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria; the 
fungi phyla Ascomycota, Chytridiomycota and Basidiomycota; and the Cercozoa 
classes Sarcomonadea, Thecofilosea and Imbricatea. We showed that microbial 
networks of the wheat landraces formed a more intricate network topology than 
that of modern wheat cultivars, suggesting that breeding selection resulted in a 
reduced ability to recruit specific microbes in the rhizosphere. The high 
connectedness of certain cercozoan taxa to bacteria and fungi indicated trophic 
network hierarchies where certain predators gain predominance over others. 
Positive correlations between protists and bacteria in landraces were preserved 
as a subset in cultivars as was the case for the Sarcomonadea class with 
Actinobacteria. The correlations between the microbiome structure and plant 
genotype observed in our results suggest the importance of top-down control by 
organisms of higher trophic levels as a key factor for understanding the drivers 
of microbiome community assembly in the rhizosphere.

Host-parasite interactions may be modulated by host- or parasite-associated 
microbes, but the role of these are often overlooked. Particularly for parasites 
with intestinal stages (either larval or adult), the host gut microbiome may 
play a key role for parasite establishment; moreover, the microbiome may change 
in response to invading parasites. Hypothesis testing at the organismal level 
may be hampered, particularly in mammalian definitive hosts, by ethical, 
logistical, and economical restrictions. Thus, invertebrates naturally serving 
as intermediate hosts to parasites with complex life cycles may inform the 
development of mammalian models as an early-stage host-parasite model. In 
addition, several important pathogens are vectored by insects, and insect gut 
microbiome-pathogen interactions may provide essential base-line knowledge, 
which may be used to control vectorborne pathogens. Here, we used the grain 
beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a host of the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta, to 
explore interactions between infection status and resident gut microbiota at two 
pre-determined time points (day two and seven) post infection. Using 16S/18S 
microbial profiling, we measured key parameters of the composition, relative 
abundance, and diversity of the host gut bacteriome and mycobiome. In addition, 
we quantified the systemic beetle immune response to infection by Phenoloxidase 
activity and hemocyte abundance. We found significant changes in the gut 
bacteriome and mycobiome in relation to infection status and beetle age. Thus, 
the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the gut of 
infected beetles and driven mostly by an increased abundance of Acinetobacter. 
In addition, the mycobiome was less abundant in infected beetles but maintained 
higher Shannon diversity in infected compared with non-infected beetles. Beetles 
treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Tetracycline) exhibited significantly 
reduced parasite establishment compared with the untreated control group, 
indicating that the host microbiome may greatly influence hatching of eggs and 
subsequent establishment of H. diminuta larvae. Our results suggest that 
experimental work using invertebrates may provide a platform for explorative 
studies of host-parasite-microbe interactions and their underlying mechanisms.

Cheese is a live food whose preparation involves procedures and microbial 
communities playing an important role for the final product. We characterized 
the bacterial and fungal diversity of seventeen different Mexican cheeses by 
high-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S/18S rDNA libraries. We propose the 
existence of bacterial and fungal core communities, where at genera level, 
bacteria include Streptococcus spp., Lactococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., 
Aerococcus spp., and Weisella spp. while at species level, the fungal community 
includes Galactomyces reessii, Scheffersomyces stipitis, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae (baker's yeast), and S. cerevisiae_rm11-1a. In addition to the 
bacterial and fungal core communities, we found members of the cheese microbiota 
that could be associated to other factors of the cheese manufacturing process. 
Co-occurrence analysis made in this work, indicates that bacterial and fungal 
communities maintain positive and negative interactions which are important to 
shape the resident microbial communities in cheeses. This work is a contribution 
to the description of the microbial diversity found in some Mexican cheeses.

BACKGROUND: Describing the microbial populations present in small grain silage 
and understanding their changes during ensiling is of interest for improving the 
nutrient value of these important forage crops. Barley, oat and triticale 
forages as well as an intercropped mixture of the 3 crops were harvested and 
ensiled in mini silos for a period of 90 days, followed by 14 days of aerobic 
exposure. Changes in fermentation characteristics and nutritive value were 
assessed in terminal silages and bacterial and fungal communities during 
ensiling and aerobic exposure were described using 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing, 
respectively.
RESULTS: All small grain silages exhibited chemical traits that were associated 
with well ensiled forages, such as low pH value (4.09 ± 0.28) and high levels of 
lactic acid (59.8 ± 14.59 mg/g DM). The number of microbial core genome 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) decreased with time of ensiling. Taxonomic 
bacterial community profiles were dominated by the Lactobacillales after 
fermentation, with a notable increase in Bacillales as a result of aerobic 
exposure. Diversity of the fungal core microbiome was shown to also be reduced 
during ensiling. Operational taxonomic units assigned to filamentous fungi were 
found in the core microbiome at ensiling and after aerobic exposure, whereas the 
Saccharomycetales were the dominate yeast population after 90 days of ensiling 
and aerobic exposure. Bacterial and fungal orders typically associated with 
silage spoilage were identified in the core microbiome after aerobic exposure.
CONCLUSION: Next Generation Sequencing was successfully used to describe 
bacterial communities and the first record of fungal communities throughout the 
process of ensiling and utilization. Adequately describing the microbial ecology 
of silages could lead to improved ensiling practices and the selection of silage 
inoculants that act synergistically with the natural forage microbiome.

Protists are ubiquitous components of terrestrial and aquatic environments, as 
well as animal and human microbiomes. Despite this, little is known about 
protists in urban environments. The ~7400-mile sewer system of New York City 
(NYC) collects human waste from ~8 million human inhabitants as well as from 
animals, street runoff, and groundwater, providing an ideal system to study 
these microbes. We used 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic 
sequencing to profile raw sewage microbial communities. Raw sewage samples were 
collected over a 12-month period from 14 treatment plants of the five NYC 
boroughs, and compared with samples from other environments including soil, 
stormwater, and sediment. Sewage contained a diverse protist community dominated 
by free-living clades, and communities were highly differentiated across 
environments. Seasonal differences in protist composition were observed; 
however, network analysis and functional profiling demonstrated that sewage 
communities were robust and functionally consistent. Protists typically 
associated with human and animal guts or feces were frequently detected. 
Abundance of these parasites varied significantly both spatially and temporally, 
suggesting that spikes could reflect trends in the source population. This 
underscores sewage as a valuable model system for monitoring patterns in urban 
microbes and provides a baseline protist metagenome of NYC.

Fungi have a complex role in the intestinal tract, influencing health and 
disease, with dysbiosis contributing to obesity. Our objectives were to 
investigate fungal diversity in human gut microbiota among eutrophic, 
overweight, and obese. Epidemiological and nutritional information were 
collected from adult individuals, as well as stool samples processed for 
selective fungi isolation and identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (yeasts) or microculture 
(filamentous fungi). Further 18S rDNA sequencing was performed to confirm 
identification. The mean count of fungi was 241 CFU/g of feces. Differences in 
the population level of the filamentous fungi were observed within eutrophic and 
obese groups. Overall, 34 genera were identified. The predominant phylum was 
Ascomycota with 20 different genera, followed by Basidiomycota and Zygomycota. 
As for Ascomycota, the most prevalent species were Paecilomyces sp., Penicillium 
sp., Candida sp., Aspergillus sp., Fonsecaea sp., and Geotrichum sp. (76.39, 
65.28, 59.72, 58.33, 12.50, and 9.72%, respectively). As for Basidiomycota, 
Trichosporon sp. and Rhodotorula sp. were the most prevalent (30.56 and 15.28%, 
respectively), and for Zygomycota, Rhizopus sp. and Mucor sp. were the most 
numerous (15.28 and 9.72%, respectively). As expected there is a mycobiota shift 
towards obesity, with slightly higher diversity associated to eutrophic 
individuals. This mycobiota shift seems also to be related to the nutritional 
behavior of the individuals, as observed that the macronutrients intake may be 
positively related to the different fungi occurrences. Other studies are needed 
to better understand relationships between mycobiota and obesity, which could be 
used in future obesity treatments.

Microbial communities control numerous biogeochemical processes critical for 
ecosystem function and health. Most analyses of coastal microbial communities 
focus on the characterization of bacteria present in either sediment or 
seawater, with fewer studies characterizing both sediment and seawater together 
at a given site, and even fewer studies including information about 
non-bacterial microbial communities. As a result, knowledge about the ecological 
patterns of microbial biodiversity across domains and habitats in coastal 
communities is limited-despite the fact that archaea, bacteria, and microbial 
eukaryotes are present and known to interact in coastal habitats. To better 
understand microbial biodiversity patterns in coastal ecosystems, we 
characterized sediment and seawater microbial communities for three sites along 
the coastline of Puerto Nuevo, Baja California, Mexico using both 16S and 18S 
rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that sediment hosted approximately 
500-fold more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for bacteria, archaea, and 
microbial eukaryotes than seawater (p < 0.001). Distinct phyla were found in 
sediment versus seawater samples. Of the top ten most abundant classes, 
Cytophagia (bacterial) and Chromadorea (eukaryal) were specific to the sediment 
environment, whereas Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidia (bacterial) and Chlorophyceae 
(eukaryal) were specific to the seawater environment. A total of 47 unique 
genera were observed to comprise the core taxa community across environment 
types and sites. No archaeal taxa were observed as part of either the abundant 
or core taxa. No significant differences were observed for sediment community 
composition across domains or between sites. For seawater, the bacterial and 
archaeal community composition was statistically different for the Major Outlet 
site (p < 0.05), the site closest to a residential area, and the eukaryal 
community composition was statistically different between all sites (p < 0.05). 
Our findings highlight the distinct patterns and spatial heterogeneity in 
microbial communities of a coastal region in Baja California, Mexico.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Water is an increasingly scarce resource while some crops, 
such as paddy rice, require large amounts of water to maintain grain production. 
A better understanding of rice drought adaptation and tolerance mechanisms could 
help to reduce this problem. There is evidence of a possible role of 
root-associated fungi in drought adaptation. Here, we analyzed the endospheric 
fungal microbiota composition in rice and its relation to plant genotype and 
drought.
METHODS: Fifteen rice genotypes (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) were grown in the 
field, under well-watered conditions or exposed to a drought period during 
flowering. The effect of genotype and treatment on the root fungal microbiota 
composition was analyzed by 18S ribosomal DNA high throughput sequencing. Grain 
yield was determined after plant maturation.
RESULTS: There was a host genotype effect on the fungal community composition. 
Drought altered the composition of the root-associated fungal community and 
increased fungal biodiversity. The majority of OTUs identified belonged to the 
Pezizomycotina subphylum and 37 of these significantly correlated with a higher 
plant yield under drought, one of them being assigned to Arthrinium 
phaeospermum.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that both plant genotype and drought affect the 
root-associated fungal community in rice and that some fungi correlate with 
improved drought tolerance. This work opens new opportunities for basic research 
on the understanding of how the host affects microbiota recruitment as well as 
the possible use of specific fungi to improve drought tolerance in rice.

Wastewater purification is mostly performed in activated sludge reactors by 
bacterial and microeukaryotic communities, populating organic flocs and a watery 
liquor. While there are numerous molecular community studies of the bacterial 
fraction, those on microeukaryotes are rare. We performed a year-long parallel 
16S rRNA gene and 18S rRNA-gene based analysis of the bacterial and of the 
microeukaryote communities, respectively, of physically separated flocs and 
particle-free liquor samples from three WWTPs. This uncovered a hitherto unknown 
large diversity of microeukaryotes largely composed of potential phagotrophs 
preferentially feeding on either bacteria or other microeukaryotes. We further 
explored whether colonization of the microhabitats was selective, showing that 
for both microbial communities, different but often closely taxonomically and 
functionally related populations exhibiting different dynamic patterns populated 
the microhabitats. An analysis of their between plants-shared core populations 
showed the microeukaryotes to be dispersal limited in comparison to bacteria. 
Finally, a detailed analysis of a weather-caused operational disruption in one 
of the plants suggested that the absence of populations common to the floc and 
liquor habitat may negatively affect resilience and stability.

The importance of planktonic microbial communities is well acknowledged, since 
they are fundamental for several natural processes of aquatic ecosystems. 
Microorganisms naturally control the flux of nutrients, and also degrade and 
recycle anthropogenic organic and inorganic contaminants. Nevertheless, climate 
change effects and/or the runoff of nutrients/pollutants can affect the 
equilibrium of natural microbial communities influencing the occurrence of 
microbial pathogens and/or microbial toxin producers, which can compromise 
ecosystem environmental status. Therefore, improved microbial plankton 
monitoring is essential to better understand how these communities respond to 
environmental shifts. The study of marine microbial communities typically 
involves highly cost and time-consuming sampling procedures, which can limit the 
frequency of sampling and data availability. In this context, we developed and 
validated an in situ autonomous biosampler (IS-ABS) able to collect/concentrate 
in situ planktonic communities of different size fractions (targeting 
prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes) for posterior genomic, metagenomic, 
and/or transcriptomic analysis at a home laboratory. The IS-ABS field prototype 
is a small size and compact system able to operate up to 150 m depth. Water is 
pumped by a micropump (TCS MG2000) through a hydraulic circuit that allows in 
situ filtration of environmental water in one or more Sterivex filters placed in 
a filter cartridge. The IS-ABS also includes an application to program sampling 
definitions, allowing pre-setting configuration of the sampling. The efficiency 
of the IS-ABS was tested against traditional laboratory filtration standardized 
protocols. Results showed a good performance in terms of DNA recovery, as well 
as prokaryotic (16S rDNA) and eukaryotic (18S rDNA) community diversity 
analysis, using either methodologies. The IS-ABS automates the process of 
collecting environmental DNA, and is suitable for integration in water 
observation systems, what will contribute to substantially increase biological 
surveillances. Also, the use of highly sensitive genomic approaches allows a 
further study of the diversity and functions of whole or specific microbial 
communities.

Microorganism communities that live inside insects can play critical roles in 
host development, nutrition, immunity, physiology, and behavior. Over the past 
decade, high-throughput sequencing reveals the extraordinary microbial diversity 
associated with various insect species and provides information independent of 
our ability to culture these microbes. However, their cultivation in the 
laboratory remains crucial for a deep understanding of their physiology and the 
roles they play in host insects. Aphids are insects that received specific 
attention because of their ability to form symbiotic associations with a wide 
range of endosymbionts that are considered as the core microbiome of these 
sap-feeding insects. But, if the functional diversity of obligate and 
facultative endosymbionts has been extensively studied in aphids, the diversity 
of gut symbionts and other associated microorganisms received limited 
consideration. Herein, we present a culture-dependent method that allowed us to 
successfully isolate microorganisms from several aphid species. The isolated 
microorganisms were assigned to 24 bacterial genera from the Actinobacteria, 
Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla and three fungal genera from the Ascomycota 
and Basidiomycota phyla. In our study, we succeeded in isolating already 
described bacteria found associated to aphids (e.g., the facultative symbiont 
Serratia symbiotica), as well as microorganisms that have never been described 
in aphids before. By unraveling a microbial community that so far has been 
ignored, our study expands our current knowledge on the microbial diversity 
associated with aphids and illustrates how fast and simple culture-dependent 
approaches can be applied to insects in order to capture their diverse 
microbiota members.

Recent work suggests that microbial community composition in high-elevation 
lakes is significantly influenced by microbes entering from upstream terrestrial 
and aquatic habitats. To test this idea, we conducted 18S and 16S rDNA surveys 
of microbial communities in a high-alpine lake in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. 
We compared the microbial community of the lake to water entering the lake and 
to uphill soils that drain into the lake. Utilizing hydrological and abiotic 
data, we identified potential factors controlling microbial diversity and 
community composition. Results show a diverse community entering the lake at the 
inlet with a strong resemblance to uphill terrestrial and aquatic communities. 
In contrast, the lake communities (water column and outlet) showed significantly 
lower diversity and were significantly different from the inlet communities. 
Assumptions of neutral community assembly poorly predicted community differences 
between the inlet and lake, whereas "variable selection" and "dispersal 
limitation" were predicted to dominate. Similarly, the lake communities were 
correlated with discharge rate, indicating that longer hydraulic residence times 
limit dispersal, allowing selective pressures within the lake to structure 
communities. Sulfate and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations 
correlated with community composition, indicating "bottom up" controls on lake 
community assembly. Furthermore, bacterial community composition was correlated 
with both zooplankton density and eukaryotic community composition, indicating 
biotic controls such as "top-down" interactions also contribute to community 
assembly in the lake. Taken together, these community analyses suggest that 
deterministic biotic and abiotic selection within the lake coupled with 
dispersal limitation structures the microbial communities in Green Lake 4.

The temporal dynamics of rhizosphere and root microbiota composition was 
compared between healthy and infected Chinese cabbage plants by the pathogen 
Plasmodiophora brassicae. When inoculated with P. brassicae, disease was 
measured at five sampling dates from early root hair infection to late gall 
development. The first symptoms of clubroot disease appeared 14 days after 
inoculation (DAI) and increased drastically between 14 and 35 DAI. The structure 
of microbial communities associated to rhizosphere soil and root from healthy 
and inoculated plants was characterized through high-throughput DNA sequencing 
of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) molecular markers and compared at each 
sampling date. In healthy plants, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes bacterial 
phyla dominated the rhizosphere and root microbiota of Chinese cabbage. 
Rhizosphere bacterial communities contained higher abundances of Actinobacteria 
and Firmicutes compared to the roots. Moreover, a drastic shift of fungal 
communities of healthy plants occurred between the two last sampling dates, 
especially in plant roots, where most of Ascomycota fungi dominated until they 
were replaced by a fungus assigned to the Chytridiomycota phylum. Parasitic 
invasion by P. brassicae disrupted the rhizosphere and root-associated community 
assembly at a late step during the root secondary cortical infection stage of 
clubroot disease. At this stage, Flavisolibacter and Streptomyces in the 
rhizosphere, and Bacillus in the roots, were drastically less abundant upon 
parasite invasion. Rhizosphere of plants colonized by P. brassicae was 
significantly more invaded by the Chytridiomycota fungus, which could reflect a 
mutualistic relationship in this compartment between these two microorganisms.

Microbial community succession is a fundamental process that affects underlying 
functions of almost all ecosystems; yet the roles and fates of the most abundant 
colonizers are often poorly understood. Does early abundance spur long term 
persistence? How do deterministic and stochastic processes influence the 
ecological contribution of colonizers? We performed a succession experiment 
within a hypersaline ecosystem to investigate how different processes 
contributed to the turnover of founder species. Bacterial and eukaryotic 
colonizers were identified during primary succession and tracked through a 
defined, 79-day biofilm maturation period using 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing 
in combination with high resolution imaging that utilized stable isotope tracers 
to evaluate successional patterns of primary producers and nitrogen fixers. The 
majority of the founder species did not maintain high abundance throughout 
succession. Species replacement (versus loss) was the dominant process shaping 
community succession. We also asked if different ecological processes acted on 
bacteria versus Eukaryotes during succession and found deterministic and 
stochastic forces corresponded more with microeukaryote and bacterial 
colonization, respectively. Our results show that taxa and functions belonging 
to different kingdoms, which share habitat in the tight spatial confines of a 
biofilm, were influenced by different ecological processes and time scales of 
succession.

cultured and 14 uncultured fungi in presently-forming, 400 and 900 years old ice 
layers, corresponding to 28 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The 
dominant ice-contained fungal OTUs were related to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and 
Cryptomycota phyla. Representatives of Mucoromycota and Chytridiomycota were 
also isolated from recent and 400 years old ice samples. The cryophilic Mrakia 
stokesii was the most abundant fungal species found in the cave ice samples of 
all prospected ages, alongside other cryophilic fungi also identified in various 
glacial environments. Ice deposits formed during the Little Ice Age (dated 
between AD 1,250 and 1,850) appeared to have a higher fungal diversity than the 
ice layer formed during the Medieval Warm Period (prior to AD 1,250). A more 
complex fungal community adapted to low temperatures was obtained from all 
analyzed ice layers when cultivated at 4 °C as compared to 15 °C, suggesting the 
dominance of cold-adapted fungi in this glacial habitat. The fungal distribution 
in the analyzed cave ice layers revealed the presence of unique OTUs in 
different aged-formed ice deposits, as a first hint for putative further 
identification of fungal biomarkers for climate variations in this icy habitat. 
This is the first report on fungi from a rock-hosted cave ice block.

Cercomonads are among the most abundant and diverse groups of heterotrophic 
flagellates in terrestrial systems and show an affinity to plants. However, we 
still lack basic knowledge of plant-associated protists. We isolated 75 
Cercomonadida strains from the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of plants from three 
functional groups: grasses (Poa sp.), legumes (Trifolium sp.) and forbs 
(Plantago sp.), representing 28 OTUs from the genera Cercomonas, Neocercomonas 
and Paracercomonas. The community composition differed clearly between 
phyllosphere and rhizosphere, but was not influenced by plant species identity. 
From these isolates we describe three novel cercomonad species including 
Neocercomonas epiphylla that was consistently and exclusively isolated from the 
phyllosphere. For each new species we provide a detailed morphological 
description as well as an 18S rDNA gene sequence as a distinct marker of species 
identity. Our data contribute to a better resolution of the systematics of 
cercomonads and their association with plants, by describing three novel species 
and adding gene sequences of 10 new cercomonad genotypes and of nine previously 
described species. In view of the functional importance of cercozoan communities 
in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of plants, a more detailed understanding of 
their composition, function and predator-prey interactions are clearly required.

Lake Lucero is a gypsum-rich, hypersaline, ephemeral playa located on the 
southern part of the Alkali Flat at the White Sands National Monument (WSNM), 
New Mexico, USA. This modern playa setting provides a dynamic extreme 
environment that changes from a freshwater lake to a hypersaline dry desert 
during the year. We investigated the microbial diversity (bacteria, archaea, and 
microbial eukaryotes) of the Lake Lucero sediments using 16S- and 18S-based 
amplicon sequencing approach and explored the diversity patterns in different 
geochemical microenvironments. Our results indicated that similar microbial 
communities, in particular bacterial communities colonized, were remarkably 
consistent across our depth profiles. Therefore, these communities show a 
first-order relevance on the environmental conditions (moisture content, oxygen 
content, and mineral composition). We found that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, 
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes were the major bacterial phyla, 
while Cyanobacteria were present in relatively low abundances and appeared only 
at the surface. Genus level assessment reflected that Truepera, Delftia, and 
Pseudomonas were the predominant bacterial genera across all samples. 
Euryarchaeota was the major archaeal phylum in all the samples, while Candidatus 
Halobonum and Candidatus Nitrososphaera were the main genera. Diatoms were the 
dominant eukaryotic group in surface samples and Fungi, Ciliophora, Metazoa, and 
Nematodes were the other major groups. As expected, metabolic inference 
indicated that aerobic microbial communities were near surface colonizers, with 
anaerobic communities dominating with increasing depth. We demonstrated 
that these microbial communities could be used to characterize unique 
geochemical microenvironments enabling us to extrapolate these results into 
other terrestrial and possibly extraterrestrial environments with comparable 
geochemical characteristics.

Natural (N) as well as starter inoculated (S, inoculated with Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae M3-5; CZS, Candida zemplinina T13, Zygosaccharomyces bailii NS113 and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae M3-5) fermentations of Falanghina must from dehydrated 
grape were monitored. Culture dependent analyses and amplicon-based 
high-throughput sequencing targeting 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes were used to 
monitor the fungal and bacterial communities (8 sampling points during 65 days). 
The resulting wines were subject to both sensory evaluation and volatile organic 
compounds analysis. Fungal community of un-inoculated musts (N) at beginning of 
the fermentation was mainly represented by Aureobasidium, Cladosporium, 
Sclerotinia, while Candida, Debaryomyces, Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowia, Pichia, 
Saccharomyces and Zygosaccharomyces showed a very low occurrence. The dominance 
of Hanseniaspora vineae and/or Hanseniaspora uvarum was clear up to 29th days of 
fermentation. S. cerevisiae occurred in all the phases but become dominant only 
at the end of the process. The odour profiles as evaluate by Quantitative 
Descriptive Analysis (QDA) highlighted a significant impact of the fungal 
populations on the olfactory profiles of the wines. Raisins, dried fruits, 
Sherry and liqueur were stronger in both S and CZS, while N was mostly 
discriminated by solvent/chemical and floral features. Outcomes underpin the 
impact of microbiota on the chemical and odour traits of Falanghina passito 
wines.

BACKGROUND: Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops have been cultivated at a large 
scale over the past several decades, which have raised concern about unintended 
effects on natural environments. Microbial communities typically contain 
numerous rare taxa that make up the majority of community populations. However, 
the response of dominant and rare taxa for fungal diversity to the different 
root environments of Bt plants remains unclear.
RESULTS: We quantified fungal population sizes and community composition via 
quantitative PCR of ITS genes and 18S rRNA gene sequencing of, respectively, 
that were associated with Bt and conventional cotton variety rhizosphere soils 
from different plant growth stages. qPCR analyses indicated that fungal 
abundances reached their peak at the seedling stage and that the taproots and 
lateral root rhizospheres of the Bt cotton SGK321 were significantly different. 
However, no significant differences in population sizes were detected between 
the same root zones from Bt and the conventional cotton varieties. The overall 
patterns of fungal genera abundances followed that of the dominant genera, 
whereas overall patterns of fungal genera richness followed those of the rare 
genera. These results suggest that the dominant and rare taxa play different 
roles in the maintenance of rhizosphere microhabitat ecosystems. Cluster 
analyses indicated a separation of fungal communities based on the lateral roots 
or taproots from the three cotton varieties at the seedling stage, suggesting 
that root microhabitats had marked effects on fungal community composition. 
Redundancy analyses indicated that pH was more correlated to soil fungal 
community composition than Bt protein content.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these results indicate that dominant and rare fungal 
taxa differentially contribute to community dynamics in different root 
microhabitats of both Bt and conventional cotton varieties. Moreover, these 
results showed that the rhizosphere fungal community of Bt cotton did not 
respond significantly to the presence of Bt protein when compared to the two 
conventional cotton varieties.

BACKGROUND: The deep-sea mussels Bathymodiolus azoricus (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) 
are the dominant macrofauna subsisting at the hydrothermal vents site Menez Gwen 
in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Their adaptive success in such challenging 
environments is largely due to their gill symbiotic association with 
chemosynthetic bacteria. We examined the response of vent mussels as they adapt 
to sea-level environmental conditions, through an assessment of the relative 
abundance of host-symbiont related RNA transcripts to better understand how the 
gill microbiome may drive host-symbiont interactions in vent mussels during 
hypothetical venting inactivity.
RESULTS: The metatranscriptome of B. azoricus was sequenced from gill tissues 
sampled at different time-points during a five-week acclimatization experiment, 
using Next-Generation-Sequencing. After Illumina sequencing, a total of 
181,985,262 paired-end reads of 150 bp were generated with an average of 
16,544,115 read per sample. Metatranscriptome analysis confirmed that 
experimental acclimatization in aquaria accounted for global gill transcript 
variation. Additionally, the analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA sequences data allowed 
for a comprehensive characterization of host-symbiont interactions, which 
included the gradual loss of gill endosymbionts and signaling pathways, 
associated with stress responses and energy metabolism, under experimental 
acclimatization. Dominant active transcripts were assigned to the following KEGG 
categories: "Ribosome", "Oxidative phosphorylation" and "Chaperones and folding 
catalysts" suggesting specific metabolic responses to physiological adaptations 
in aquarium environment.
CONCLUSIONS: Gill metagenomics analyses highlighted microbial diversity shifts 
and a clear pattern of varying mRNA transcript abundancies and expression during 
acclimatization to aquarium conditions which indicate change in bacterial 
community activity. This approach holds potential for the discovery of new 
host-symbiont associations, evidencing new functional transcripts and a clearer 
picture of methane metabolism during loss of endosymbionts. Towards the end of 
acclimatization, we observed trends in three major functional subsystems, as 
evidenced by an increment of transcripts related to genetic information 
processes; the decrease of chaperone and folding catalysts and oxidative 
phosphorylation transcripts; but no change in transcripts of gluconeogenesis and 
co-factors-vitamins.

Interest in the human microbiome has increased dramatically in the last decade. 
However, much of this research has focused on bacteria, while the composition 
and roles of their fungal counterparts remain less understood. Furthermore, a 
variety of methodological approaches have been applied, and the comparability 
between studies is unclear. This study compared four primer pairs targeting the 
small subunit (SSU) rRNA (18S), ITS1, ITS2, and large subunit (LSU) rRNA (26S) 
genomic regions for their ability to accurately characterize fungal communities 
typical of the human mycobiota. All four target regions of 21 individual fungal 
mock community taxa were capable of being amplified adequately and sequenced. 
Mixed mock community analyses revealed marked variability in the ability of each 
primer pair to accurately characterize a complex community. ITS target regions 
outperformed LSU and SSU. Of the ITS regions, ITS1 failed to generate sequences 
for Yarrowia lipolytica and all three Malassezia species when in a mixed 
community. These findings were further supported in studies of human sinonasal 
and mouse fecal samples. Based on these analyses, previous studies using ITS1, 
SSU, or LSU markers may omit key taxa that are identified by the ITS2 marker. Of 
methods commonly used in human mycobiota studies to date, we recommend selection 
of the ITS2 marker. Further investigation of more recently developed fungal 
primer options will be essential to ultimately determine the optimal 
methodological approach by which future human mycobiota studies ought to be 
standardized.

BACKGROUND: Eukaryotes are ubiquitous in natural environments such as soil and 
freshwater. Little is known of their presence in drinking water distribution 
systems (DWDSs) or of the environmental conditions that affect their activity 
and survival.
METHODS: Eukaryotes were characterized by Illumina high-throughput sequencing 
targeting 18S rRNA gene (DNA) that estimates the total community and the 18S 
rRNA gene transcript (RNA) that is more representative of the active part of the 
community. DWDS cold water (N = 124), hot water (N = 40), and biofilm (N = 16) 
samples were collected from four cities in Finland. The sampled DWDSs were from 
two waterworks A-B with non-disinfected, recharged groundwater as source water 
and from three waterworks utilizing chlorinated water (two DWDSs of surface 
waterworks C-D and one of ground waterworks E). In each DWDS, samples were 
collected from three locations during four seasons of 1 year.
RESULTS: A beta-diversity analysis revealed that the main driver shaping the 
eukaryotic communities was the DWDS (A-E) (R = 0.73, P < 0.001, ANOSIM). The 
kingdoms Chloroplastida (green plants and algae), Metazoa (animals: rotifers, 
nematodes), Fungi (e.g., Cryptomycota), Alveolata (ciliates, dinoflagellates), 
and Stramenopiles (algae Ochrophyta) were well represented and active-judging 
based on the rRNA gene transcripts-depending on the surrounding conditions. The 
unchlorinated cold water of systems (A-B) contained a higher estimated total 
number of taxa (Chao1, average 380-480) than chlorinated cold water in systems 
C-E (Chao1 ≤ 210). Within each DWDS, unique eukaryotic communities were 
identified at different locations as was the case also for cold water, hot 
water, and biofilms. A season did not have a consistent impact on the eukaryotic 
community among DWDSs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively characterized the eukaryotic community 
members within the DWDS of well-maintained ground and surface waterworks 
providing good quality water. The study gives an indication that each DWDS 
houses a unique eukaryotic community, mainly dependent on the raw water source 
and water treatment processes in place at the corresponding waterworks. In 
particular, disinfection as well as hot water temperature seemed to represent a 
strong selection pressure that controlled the number of active eukaryotic 
species.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are the most prominent mycobionts of plants 
in the tropics, yet little is known about their diversity, species compositions 
and factors driving AMF distribution patterns. To investigate whether elevation 
and associated vegetation type affect species composition, we sampled 646 
mycorrhizal samples in locations between 1000 and 4000 m above sea level (masl) 
in the South of Ecuador. We estimated diversity, distribution and species 
compositions of AMF by cloning and Sanger sequencing the 18S rDNA (the section 
between AML1 and AML2) and subsequent derivation of fungal OTUs based on 99% 
sequence similarity. In addition, we analyzed the phylogenetic structure of the 
sites by computing the mean pairwise distance (MPD) and the mean nearest taxon 
difference (MNTD) for each elevation level. It revealed that AMF species 
compositions at 1000 and 2000 masl differ from 3000 and 4000 masl. Lower 
elevations (1000 and 2000 masl) were dominated by members of Glomeraceae, 
whereas Acaulosporaceae were more abundant in higher elevations (3000 and 4000 
masl). Ordination of OTUs with respect to study sites revealed a correlation to 
elevation with a continuous turnover of species from lower to higher elevations. 
Most of the abundant OTUs are not endemic to South Ecuador. We also found a high 
proportion of rare OTUs at all elevations: 79-85% of OTUs occurred in less than 
5% of the samples. Phylogenetic community analysis indicated clustering and 
evenness for most elevation levels indicating that both, stochastic processes 
and habitat filtering are driving factors of AMF community compositions.

Plant litter decomposition is a process enabling biogeochemical cycles closing 
in ecosystems, and decomposition in forests constitutes the largest part of this 
process taking place in terrestrial biomes. Microbial communities during litter 
decomposition were studied mainly with low-throughput techniques not allowing 
detailed insight, particularly into coniferous litter, as it is more difficult 
to obtain high quality DNA required for analyses. Motivated by these problems, 
we analyzed archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities at three 
decomposition stages: fresh, 3- and 8-month-old litter by 16/18S rDNA 
pyrosequencing, aiming at detailed insight into early stages of pine litter 
decomposition. Archaea were absent from our libraries. Bacterial and eukaryotic 
diversity was greatest in 8-month-old litter and the same applied to bacterial 
and fungal rDNA content. Community structure was different at various stages of 
decomposition, and phyllospheric organisms (bacteria: Acetobacteraceae and 
Pseudomonadaceae members, fungi: Lophodermium, Phoma) were replaced by 
communities with metabolic capabilities adapted to the particular stage of 
decomposition. Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae and fungal genera 
Sistotrema, Ceuthospora, and Athelia were characteristic for 3-month-old 
samples, while 8-month-old ones were characterized by Bradyrhizobiaceae and 
nematodes (Plectus). We suggest that bacterial and eukaryotic decomposer 
communities change at different stages of pine litter decomposition in a way 
similar to that in broadleaf litter. Interactions between bacteria and 
eukaryotes appear to be one of the key drivers of microbial community structure.

Over the years, the potential pathogenicity of Acanthamoeba for humans and 
animals has gained increasing attention from the scientific community. More than 
24 species belong to this genus, however only some of them are causative agents 
of keratitis and encephalitis in humans. Due to technical difficulties in 
diagnosis, these infections are likely to be under-detected. The introduction of 
18S rDNA amplification for the identification of Acanthamoeba has dramatically 
enhanced diagnosis performances, but the attestation of genotyping requires 
supplementary sequencing-based procedures. In this study, 15 Acanthamoeba 
strains were collected and grown on nutrient agar media. Each strain was 
genotyped by end-point PCR assay for the amplification of the 18S rDNA gene and 
the genotype was assigned by sequencing analysis through neighbor joining 
phylogenetic tree. In order to optimize standardization of the MALDI-TOF MS 
assay, we established the collection time point at the cystic phase. Two strains 
of each genotype were randomly chosen to customize the biotyper database. For 
all strains, 24 spectral measurements were acquired and submitted to 
identification and cluster analysis of spectra. The obtained results highlighted 
the correct identification of Acanthamoeba strains and the overlapping of 
spectra dendrogram clusters to the 18S genotype assignations. In conclusion, the 
MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper revealed the capability to identify and genotype the 
Acanthamoeba strains, providing a new frontier in the diagnostic identification 
of amaebae and in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies.

Death investigations often include an effort to establish the postmortem 
interval (PMI) in cases in which the time of death is uncertain. The postmortem 
interval can lead to the identification of the deceased and the validation of 
witness statements and suspect alibis. Recent research has demonstrated that 
microbes provide an accurate clock that starts at death and relies on ecological 
change in the microbial communities that normally inhabit a body and its 
surrounding environment. Here, we explore how to build the most robust Random 
Forest regression models for prediction of PMI by testing models built on 
different sample types (gravesoil, skin of the torso, skin of the head), gene 
markers (16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer regions 
(ITS)), and taxonomic levels (sequence variants, species, genus, etc.). We also 
tested whether particular suites of indicator microbes were informative across 
different datasets. Generally, results indicate that the most accurate models 
for predicting PMI were built using gravesoil and skin data using the 16S rRNA 
genetic marker at the taxonomic level of phyla. Additionally, several phyla 
consistently contributed highly to model accuracy and may be candidate 
indicators of PMI.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important facilities to control water 
pollution and ensure the sustainable development of cities and humans. As an 
indispensable part of the activated sludge (AS) system, eukaryotic microbes play 
important roles in indicating the properties of AS, predicting the quality of 
the effluent, enhancing the purification effect, and ensuring a stable 
performance of the system in WWTPs. In this study, 61 AS samples from 14 
full-scale WWTPs of Beijing, Shenzhen, and Wuxi were collected. Characteristics 
and regional heterogeneity of eukaryotic microbial community were elucidated via 
high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 18S rDNA and multi ecological and 
statistical methods. Results showed that eukaryotic microbial communities in 
different scales shared similar main members, which were mainly composed of 
fungi, ciliophora, and metazoa in division level with their total relative 
abundance up to 86.22%-89.40%. Diversity of eukaryotic microbial community in 
WWTPs of different cites varied. Richness and Shannon Wiener index of eukaryotic 
microbial communities in the AS system of Wuxi were the highest, while that of 
Beijing was the lowest. Diversity of eukaryotic microbes from HTS in this study 
was higher than that of conventional methods, but lower than the diversity of 
bacteria in AS systems. Regional heterogeneity of eukaryotic microbial community 
structure was uncovered by nonmetric multidimensional scaling based on 
Bray-Curtis distance and dissimilarity analysis. Results of partial mantel test 
and multiple regression matrix analysis showed that the eukaryotic microbial 
community was significantly correlated with the temperature of the aeration tank 
mixture and the total nitrogen concentration of the effluent of the AS system. 
These results help deepen the understanding of eukaryotic microbes in WWTPs.

Marine net community production (NCP) tracks uptake of carbon by plankton 
communities and its potential transport to depth. Relationships between marine 
microbial community composition and NCP currently remain unclear despite their 
importance for assessing how different taxa impact carbon export. We conducted 
16 and 18S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequencing on samples collected across the Western 
North Atlantic in parallel with high-resolution O2/Ar-derived NCP measurements. 
Using an internal standard technique to estimate in-situ prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic rDNA abundances per liter, we employed statistical approaches to 
relate patterns of microbial diversity to NCP. Taxonomic abundances calculated 
using internal standards provided valuable context to traditional relative 
abundance metrics. A bloom in the Mid-Atlantic Bight featured high eukaryote 
abundances with low eukaryotic diversity and was associated with the harmful 
algal bloom-forming Aureococcus anophagefferens, phagotrophic algae, 
heterotrophic flagellates, and particle-associated bacteria. These results show 
that coastal Aureococcus blooms host a distinct community associated with 
regionally significant peaks in NCP. Meanwhile, weak relationships between 
taxonomy and NCP in less-productive waters suggest that productivity across much 
of this region is not linked to specific microplankton taxa.

Inorganic fertilization and mowing alter soil factors with subsequent 
effects-direct and indirect - on above- and below-ground communities. We 
explored direct and indirect effects of long-term fertilization (N, P, NPK, 
Liming) and twice yearly mowing on the plant, bacterial and fungal communities 
and soil factors. We analyzed co-variation using 16S and 18S rRNA genes surveys, 
and plant frequency and edaphic factors across treatments. The plant and fungal 
communities were distinct in the NPK and L treatments, while the bacterial 
communities and soil factors were distinct in the N and L treatments. Plant 
community diversity and evenness had low diversity in the NPK and high diversity 
in the liming treatment, while the diversity and evenness of the bacterial and 
fungal communities did not differ across treatments, except of higher diversity 
and evenness in the liming treatment for the bacteria. We found significant 
co-structures between communities based on plant and fungal comparisons but not 
between plant and bacterial nor bacterial and fungal comparisons. Our results 
suggested that the plant and fungal communities are more tightly linked than 
either community with the bacterial community in fertilized soils. We found 
co-varying plant, bacterial and fungal taxa in different treatments that may 
indicate ecological interactions.

Protists, abundant but enigmatic single-celled eukaryotes, are important soil 
microbiota providing numerous ecosystem functions. We employed high-throughput 
sequencing of environmental DNA, targeting the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene, 
to characterize changes in their abundance, species richness, and community 
structure with conversion of lowland rainforest into rubber agroforest (jungle 
rubber), and rubber and oil palm plantations; typical agricultural systems in 
Sumatra, Indonesia. We identified 5,204 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 
97% identity threshold of protists from 32 sites. Protists species richness was 
similar in rainforest, jungle rubber and oil palm plantations but significantly 
lower in rubber plantations. After standardization, 4,219 OTUs were assigned to 
five trophic groups, and inspected for effects of land-use change, and potential 
biotic and abiotic driving factors. The most abundant trophic group was 
phagotrophs (52%), followed by animal parasites (29%), photoautotrophs (12%), 
plant parasites (1%), and symbionts (<1%). However, the relative abundance and 
OTU richness of phagotrophs and photoautotrophs increased significantly with 
increasing land-use intensity. This was similar, but less pronounced, for the 
relative abundance of symbionts. Animal and plant parasites decreased 
significantly in abundance and species richness with increasing land-use 
intensity. Community compositions and factors affecting the structure of 
individual trophic groups differed between land-use systems. Parasites were 
presumably mainly driven by the abundance and species richness of their hosts, 
while phagotrophs by changes in soil pH and increase in Gram-positive bacteria, 
and photoautotrophs by light availability. Overall, the results show that 
relative species richness, relative abundance, and community composition of 
individual trophic groups of protists in tropical lowland rainforest 
significantly differ from that in converted ecosystems. This is likely 
associated with changes in ecosystem functioning. The study provides novel 
insight into protist communities and their changes with land-use intensity in 
tropical lowland ecosystems. We show, that trophic groups of protists are 
powerful indicators reflecting changes in the functioning of ecosystems with 
conversion of rainforest into monoculture plantations.

Ciprofloxacin (CIP), one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in water 
systems, has become an aquatic contaminant because of improper disposal and 
excretion by humans and animals. It is still unknown how trace amounts of CIP 
affect the aquatic microbial community diversity and function. We therefore 
investigated the effects of CIP on the structure and function of freshwater 
microbial communities via 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing and metatranscriptomic 
analyses. CIP treatment (7 μg/L) did not significantly alter the physical and 
chemical condition of the water body as well as the composition of the main 
species in the community, but slightly increased the relative abundance of 
cyanobacteria and decreased the relative abundance of eukaryotes. 
Metatranscriptomic results showed that bacteria enhanced their phosphorus 
transport and photosynthesis after CIP exposure. The replication, transcription, 
translation and cell proliferation were all suppressed in eukaryotes, while the 
bacteria were not affected in any of these aspects. This interesting phenomenon 
was the exact opposite to both the antibacterial property of CIP and its safety 
for eukaryotes. We hypothesize that reciprocal and antagonistic interactions in 
the microcosm both contribute to this result: cyanobacteria may enhance their 
tolerance to CIP through benefiting from cross-feeding and some secreted 
substances that withstand bacterial CIP stress would also affect eukaryotic 
growth. The present study thus indicates that a detailed assessment of the 
aquatic ecotoxicity of CIP is essential, as the effects of CIP are much more 
complicated in microbial communities than in monocultures. CIP will continue to 
be an environmental contaminant due to its wide usage and production and more 
attention should be given to the negative effects of antibiotics as well as 
other bioactive pollutants on aquatic environments.

The pelagic zone of Lake Baikal is an ecological niche where phytoplankton bloom 
causes increasing microbial abundance in spring which plays a key role in carbon 
turnover in the freshwater lake. Co-occurrence patterns revealed among different 
microbes can be applied to predict interactions between the microbes and 
environmental conditions in the ecosystem. We used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S 
rRNA and 18S rRNA genes to study bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities 
and their co-occurrence patterns at the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal during a 
spring phytoplankton bloom. We found that microbes within one domain mostly 
correlated positively with each other and are highly interconnected. The highly 
connected taxa in co-occurrence networks were operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 
of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and autotrophic and 
unclassified Eukaryota which might be analogous to microbial keystone taxa. 
Constrained correspondence analysis revealed the relationships of bacterial and 
microbial eukaryotic communities with geographical location.

Cryoconite holes (cylindrical melt-holes on the glacier surface) are important 
hydrological and biological systems within glacial environments that support 
diverse microbial communities and biogeochemical processes. This study describes 
retrievable heterotrophic microbes in cryoconite hole water from three 
geographically distinct sites in Antarctica, and a Himalayan glacier, along with 
their potential to degrade organic compounds found in these environments. 
Microcosm experiments (22 days) show that 13-60% of the dissolved organic carbon 
in the water within cryoconite holes is bio-available to resident microbes. 
Biodegradation tests of organic compounds such as lactate, acetate, formate, 
propionate and oxalate that are present in cryoconite hole water show that 
microbes have good potential to metabolize the compounds tested. Substrate 
utilization tests on Biolog Ecoplate show that microbial communities in the 
Himalayan samples are able to oxidize a diverse array of organic substrates 
including carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids, amines/amides and 
polymers, while Antarctic communities generally utilized complex polymers. In 
addition, as determined by the extracellular enzyme activities, majority of the 
microbes (82%, total of 355) isolated in this study (Proteobacteria, 
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Basidiomycota) had ability to 
degrade a variety of compounds such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, 
cellulose and lignin that are documented to be present within cryoconite holes. 
Thus, microbial communities have good potential to metabolize organic compounds 
found in the cryoconite hole environment, thereby influencing the water 
chemistry in these holes. Moreover, microbes exported downstream during melting 
and flushing of cryoconite holes may participate in carbon cycling processes in 
recipient ecosystems.

BACKGROUND: Studies of environmental microbiota typically target only specific 
groups of microorganisms, with most focusing on bacteria through taxonomic 
classification of 16S rRNA gene sequences. For a more holistic understanding of 
a microbiome, a strategy to characterize the viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic 
components is necessary.
RESULTS: We developed a method for metagenomic and amplicon-based analysis of 
freshwater samples involving the concentration and size-based separation of 
eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral fractions. Next-generation sequencing and 
culture-independent approaches were used to describe and quantify microbial 
communities in watersheds with different land use in British Columbia. Deep 
amplicon sequencing was used to investigate the distribution of certain viruses 
(g23 and RdRp), bacteria (16S rRNA and cpn60), and eukaryotes (18S rRNA and 
ITS). Metagenomic sequencing was used to further characterize the gene content 
of the bacterial and viral fractions at both taxonomic and functional levels.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a systematic approach to separate and 
characterize eukaryotic-, bacterial-, and viral-sized particles. Methodologies 
described in this research have been applied in temporal and spatial studies to 
study the impact of land use on watershed microbiomes in British Columbia.

Movile Cave is a small system of partially inundated galleries in limestone 
settings close to the Black Sea in Southeast Romania. Isolated from the surface 
for 6 million years, its sulfidic, methane and ammonia-rich waters harbour 
unique chemosynthetic prokaryotic communities that include sulphur and 
ammonium-metabolizing chemolithotrophs, methanogens, methanotrophs and 
methylotrophs. The cave also harbours cave-dwelling invertebrates and fungi, but 
the diversity of other microbial eukaryotes remained completely unknown. Here, 
we apply an 18S rRNA gene-based metabarcoding approach to study the composition 
of protist communities in floating microbial mats and plankton from a 
well-preserved oxygen-depleted cave chamber. Our results reveal a wide protist 
diversity with, as dominant groups, ciliates (Alveolata), Stramenopiles, 
especially bicosoecids, and jakobids (Excavata). Ciliate sequences dominated 
both, microbial mats and plankton, followed by either Stramenopiles or 
excavates. Stramenopiles were more prominent in microbial mats, whereas jakobids 
dominated the plankton fraction of the oxygen-depleted water column. Mats 
cultured in the laboratory were enriched in Cercozoa. Consistent with local low 
oxygen levels, Movile Cave protists are most likely anaerobic or 
microaerophilic. Several newly detected OTU clades were very divergent from 
cultured species or environmental sequences in databases and represent 
phylogenetic novelty, notably within jakobids. Movile Cave protists likely cover 
a variety of ecological roles in this ecosystem including predation, parasitism, 
saprotrophy and possibly diverse prokaryote-protist syntrophies.

In patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(allo-HSCT), treatment-induced changes to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) 
microbiome have been linked to adverse outcomes, most notably graft-versus-host 
disease (GvHD). However, it is presently unknown whether this relationship is 
causal or consequential. Here, we performed an integrated meta-omic analysis to 
probe deeper into the GIT microbiome changes during allo-HSCT and its 
accompanying treatments. We used 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to 
resolve archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes within the GIT microbiomes of 16 
patients undergoing allo-HSCT for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. 
These results revealed a major shift in the GIT microbiome after allo-HSCT 
including a marked reduction in bacterial diversity, accompanied by only limited 
changes in eukaryotes and archaea. An integrated analysis of metagenomic and 
metatranscriptomic data was performed on samples collected from a patient before 
and after allo-HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia. This patient developed severe 
GvHD, leading to death 9 months after allo-HSCT. In addition to drastically 
decreased bacterial diversity, the post-treatment microbiome showed a higher 
overall number and higher expression levels of antibiotic resistance genes 
(ARGs). One specific Escherichia coli strain causing a paravertebral abscess was 
linked to GIT dysbiosis, suggesting loss of intestinal barrier integrity. The 
apparent selection for bacteria expressing ARGs suggests that prophylactic 
antibiotic administration may adversely affect the overall treatment outcome. We 
therefore assert that such analyses including information about the selection of 
pathogenic bacteria expressing ARGs may assist clinicians in "personalizing" 
regimens for individual patients to improve overall outcomes.

Microbial eukaryotes have important roles in marine food webs, but their 
diversity and activities in hydrothermal vent ecosystems are poorly 
characterized. In this study, we analyzed microbial eukaryotic communities 
associated with bacterial (Beggiatoa) mats in the 2,000 m deep-sea Guaymas Basin 
hydrothermal vent system using 18S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing of the 
V4 region. We detected 6,954 distinct Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) across 
various mat systems. Of the sequences that aligned with known protistan 
phylotypes, most were affiliated with alveolates (especially dinoflagellates and 
ciliates) and cercozoans. OTU richness and community structure differed among 
sediment habitats (e.g. different mat types and cold sediments away from mats). 
Additionally, full-length 18S rRNA genes amplified and cloned from single cells 
revealed the identities of some of the most commonly encountered, active 
ciliates in this hydrothermal vent ecosystem. Observations and experiments were 
also conducted to demonstrate that ciliates were trophically active and 
ingesting fluorescent bacteria or Beggiatoa trichomes. Our work suggests that 
the active and diverse protistan community at the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal 
vent ecosystem likely consumes substantial amounts of bacterial biomass, and 
that the different habitats, often defined by distances of just a few 10s of cm, 
select for particular assemblages and levels of diversity.

BACKGROUND: The role of the fungal microbiota in digestive diseases is poorly 
defined, but is becoming better understood due to advances in metagenomics.
AIM: To review the gastrointestinal fungal microbiota and its relationship with 
digestive diseases.
METHODS: Search of the literature using PubMed and MEDLINE databases. Subject 
headings including 'fungal-bacterial interactions', 'mycotoxins', 'immunity to 
fungi', 'fungal infection', 'fungal microbiota', 'mycobiome' and 'digestive 
diseases' were used.
RESULTS: The fungal microbiota is an integral part of the gastrointestinal 
microecosystem with up to 10(6) microorganisms per gram of faeces. 
Next-generation sequencing of the fungal 18S rRNA gene has allowed better 
characterisation of the gastrointestinal mycobiome. Numerous interactions 
between fungi and bacteria and the complex immune response to gastrointestinal 
commensal or pathogenic fungi all impact on the pathophysiology of inflammatory 
bowel disease and other gastrointestinal inflammatory entities such as peptic 
ulcers. Mycotoxins generated as fungal metabolites contribute to disturbances of 
gastrointestinal barrier and immune functions and are associated with chronic 
intestinal inflammatory conditions as well as hepatocellular and 
oesophagogastric cancer. Systemic and gastrointestinal disease can also lead to 
secondary fungal infections. Fungal genomic databases and methodologies need to 
be further developed and will allow a much better understanding of the diversity 
and function of the mycobiome in gastrointestinal inflammation, tumourigenesis, 
liver cirrhosis and transplantation, and its alteration as a consequence of 
antibiotic therapy and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The fungal microbiota and its metabolites impact gastrointestinal 
function and contribute to the pathogenesis of digestive diseases. Further 
metagenomic analyses of the gastrointestinal mycobiome in health and disease is 
needed.

Metagenomics is the collective sequencing of co-existing microbial communities 
which are ubiquitous across various clinical and ecological environments. Due to 
the large volume and random short sequences (reads) obtained from community 
sequences, analysis of diversity, abundance and functions of different organisms 
within these communities are challenging tasks. We present a fast and scalable 
clustering algorithm for analyzing large-scale metagenome sequence data. Our 
approach achieves efficiency by partitioning the large number of sequence reads 
into groups (called canopies) using hashing. These canopies are then refined by 
using state-of-the-art sequence clustering algorithms. This canopy-clustering 
(CC) algorithm can be used as a pre-processing phase for computationally 
expensive clustering algorithms. We use and compare three hashing schemes for 
canopy construction with five popular and state-of-the-art sequence clustering 
methods. We evaluate our clustering algorithm on synthetic and real-world 16S 
and whole metagenome benchmarks. We demonstrate the ability of our proposed 
approach to determine meaningful Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) and observe 
significant speedup with regards to run time when compared to different 
clustering algorithms. We also make our source code publicly available on 
Github. a.

Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often 
suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and many are diagnosed with irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous studies, including from our laboratory, have 
demonstrated that the ME/CFS gut bacterial composition is altered and less 
diverse when compared to healthy individuals. Patients have increased biomarkers 
of inflammation and leaky gut syndrome. To further investigate dysbiosis in the 
ME/CFS gut microbiome, we sought to characterize the eukaryotes present in the 
gut of 49 individuals with ME/CFS and 39 healthy controls. Using 18S rRNA 
sequencing, we have identified eukaryotes in stool samples of 17 healthy 
individuals and 17 ME/CFS patients. Our analysis demonstrates a small, 
nonsignificant decrease in eukaryotic diversity in ME/CFS patients compared to 
healthy individuals. In addition, ME/CFS patients show a nonsignificant increase 
in the ratio of fungal phyla Basidiomycota to Ascomycota, which is consistent 
with ongoing inflammation in ME/CFS. We did not identify specific eukaryotic 
taxa that are associated with ME/CFS disease status.

IMPORTANCE: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the persistent inflammation of the 
sinus and nasal passages lasting over 3 months. The etiology of CRS is not well 
understood.
OBJECTIVE: To obtain insights into the disease process, we contrasted the 
microbiome and immune response from patients with CRS and healthy controls.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case vs control design was used. Samples 
were collected in the operating room in an institutional hospital or clinic. 
Thirty patients with CRS and 12 healthy controls undergoing surgery were 
recruited.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The microbiome was analyzed by deep sequencing of 
the bacterial 16S and fungal 18S ribosomal RNA genes. Immune response was 
measured by quantification of 30 different cytokines by multiplexed 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immune cells in the lavage were 
identified by flow cytometry. The immune response of peripheral blood leukocytes 
to the lavage microbiota was assessed by interleukin (IL)-5 enzyme-linked 
immunospot assay.
RESULTS: While quantitative increase in most bacterial and fungal species was 
observed in patients with CRS relative to controls, the microbiomes of patients 
with CRS were qualitatively similar to the controls. Because these results 
indicated that bacteria and fungi are not triggering CRS, we undertook a more 
detailed characterization of the immune response. Patients with CRS had 
increased levels of the following cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, and IL-13, along 
with increased levels of eosinophils and basophils in the lavage. Importantly, 
peripheral blood leukocytes isolated from patients with CRS responded to control 
lavage samples (ie, to commensals) to produce IL-5. In contrast, the same lavage 
sample evoked no IL-5 production in leukocytes from healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings support the theory that in some cases 
CRS results from an immune hyperresponsiveness to commensal organisms.

Concentrated seabed deposits of polymetallic nodules, which are rich in 
economically valuable metals (e.g., copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese), occur 
over vast areas of the abyssal Pacific Ocean floor. Little is currently known 
about the diversity of microorganisms inhabiting abyssal habitats. In this 
study, sediment, nodule, and water column samples were collected from the 
Clarion-Clipperton Zone of the Eastern North Pacific. The diversities of 
prokaryote and microeukaryote communities associated with these habitats were 
examined. Microbial community composition and diversity varied with habitat 
type, water column depth, and sediment horizon. Thaumarchaeota were relatively 
enriched in the sediments and nodules compared to the water column, whereas 
Gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant sequences associated with nodules. 
Among the Eukaryota, rRNA genes belonging to the Cryptomonadales were relatively 
most abundant among organisms associated with nodules, whereas rRNA gene 
sequences deriving from members of the Alveolata were relatively enriched in 
sediments and the water column. Nine operational taxonomic unit (OTU)s were 
identified that occur in all nodules in this dataset, as well as all nodules 
found in a study 3000-9000 km from our site. Microbial communities in the 
sediments had the highest diversity, followed by nodules, and then by the water 
column with <1/3 the number of OTUs as in the sediments.

Improved sequencing and analytical techniques allow for better resolution of 
microbial communities; however, the agriculture field lacks an updated analysis 
surveying the fecal microbial populations of dairy cattle in California. This 
study is a large-scale survey to determine the composition of the bacterial 
community present in the feces of lactating dairy cattle on commercial dairy 
operations. For the study, 10 dairy farms across northern and central California 
representing a variety of feeding and management systems were enrolled. The 
farms represented three typical housing types including five freestall, two 
drylot and three pasture-based management systems. Fresh feces were collected 
from 15 randomly selected cows on each farm and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing. This study found that housing type, individual farm, and 
dietary components significantly affected the alpha diversity of the fecal 
microbiota. While only one Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) was common among all 
the sampled individuals, 15 bacterial families and 27 genera were shared among 
95% of samples. The ratio of the families Coriobacteriaceae to 
Bifidobacteriaceae was significantly different between housing types and farms 
with pasture fed animals having a higher relative abundance of 
Coriobacteriaceae. A majority of samples were positive for at least one OTU 
assigned to Enterobacteriaceae and 31% of samples contained OTUs assigned to 
Campylobacter. However, the relative abundance of both taxa was <0.1%. The 
microbial composition displays individual farm specific signatures, but housing 
type plays a role. These data provide insights into the composition of the core 
fecal microbiota of commercial dairy cows in California and will further 
generate hypotheses for strategies to manipulate the microbiome of cattle.

Microbial decay processes are one of the mechanisms whereby sewage contamination 
is reduced in the environment. This decomposition process involves a highly 
complex array of bacterial and eukaryotic communities from both sewage and 
ambient waters. However, relatively little is known about how these communities 
change due to mixing and subsequent decomposition of the sewage contaminant. We 
investigated decay of sewage in upper Mississippi River using Illumina 
sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA gene hypervariable regions and qPCR for 
human-associated and general fecal Bacteroidales indicators. Mixtures of primary 
treated sewage and river water were placed in dialysis bags and incubated in 
situ under ambient conditions for seven days. We assessed changes in microbial 
community composition under two treatments in a replicated factorial design: 
sunlight exposure versus shaded and presence versus absence of native river 
microbiota. Initial diversity was higher in sewage compared to river water for 
16S sequences, but the reverse was observed for 18S sequences. Both treatments 
significantly shifted community composition for eukaryotes and bacteria 
(P < 0.05). Data indicated that the presence of native river microbiota, rather 
than exposure to sunlight, accounted for the majority of variation between 
treatments for both 16S (R = 0.50; P > 0.001) and 18S (R = 0.91; P = 0.001) 
communities. A comparison of 16S sequence data and fecal indicator qPCR 
measurements indicated that the latter was a good predictor of overall bacterial 
community change over time (rho: 0.804-0.814, P = 0.001). These findings suggest 
that biotic interactions, such as predation by bacterivorous protozoa, can be 
critical factors in the decomposition of sewage in freshwater habitats and 
support the use of Bacteroidales genetic markers as indicators of fecal 
pollution.

Apple replant disease (ARD) is a severe problem in apple production worldwide. 
It is caused by a complex of soil biota, leading to small discolorated roots, as 
well as increased biosynthesis of phytoalexins, total phenolic compounds and 
antioxidants. We sampled soil from randomized field plots with either apple 
trees affected by ARD, which were five times replanted every second year, or 
with healthy trees growing in plots, which had a grass cover during this period. 
We investigated the contribution of nematodes to ARD by dissecting the soil 
biota from plots infested with ARD and non-infested control plots into a 
nematode and a microbe fraction. Nematode communities significantly differed 
between ARD and control soil as revealed by high-throughput sequencing of 18S 
rRNA genes. Plant-parasitic nematodes were too low in abundance to explain root 
damage, and did not significantly differ between ARD and control soil. Their 
separate and synergistic effect on ARD symptoms of susceptible M26 apple 
rootstocks was analyzed 4 and 8 weeks after inoculation in three greenhouse 
experiments. Inoculants were either nematodes from ARD plots (NARD), NARD plus 
microbes from ARD plots (MARD), NARD plus microbes from control plots (MCon), 
nematodes from control plots NCon plus MARD, NCon plus MCon, MARD, or MCon, or 
non-inoculated control. In all three experiments, the combination NARD plus MARD 
had the strongest adverse effect on the plants, with respect to growth 
parameters of shoots and roots, total phenolic compounds and phytoalexins in 
roots, and antioxidants in leaves. NARD also induced ARD but less than NARD plus 
MARD. NARD plus MCon had delayed effects on the plants compared to NARD plus 
MARD, suggesting that detrimental nematode-microbe interactions built up with 
time. Effects of MARD or NCon plus MARD were minor or not distinguishable from 
those of MCon or non-inoculated control. Overall, the source of the inoculated 
nematodes -ARD or control soil- and the interaction between ARD nematodes and 
microbes were highly significant factors determining ARD. In conclusion, 
exploring the associations of nematodes and microbes in ARD soils will give the 
chance to unravel the etiology of ARD.

The tick microbiota may influence the colonization of Ixodes scapularis by 
Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease bacterium. Using conserved and 
pathogen-specific primers we performed a cross-kingdom analysis of bacterial, 
fungal, protistan and archaeal communities of I. scapularis nymphs (N = 105) 
collected from southern Vermont, USA. The bacterial community was dominated by a 
Rickettsia and several environmental taxa commonly reported in I. scapularis, as 
well as the human pathogens B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, agent 
of human granulocytic anaplasmosis. With the fungal primer set we detected 
primarily plant- and litter-associated taxa and >18% of sequences were 
Malassezia, a fungal genus associated with mammalian skin. Two 18S rRNA gene 
primer sets, intended to target protistan communities, returned mostly Ixodes 
DNA as well as the wildlife pathogen Babesia odocoilei (7% of samples), a 
Gregarines species (14%) and a Spirurida nematode (18%). Data from 
pathogen-specific and conserved primers were consistent in terms of prevalence 
and identification. We measured B. burgdorferi presence/absence and load and 
found that bacterial beta diversity varied based on B. burgdorferi 
presence/absence. Load was weakly associated with bacterial community 
composition. We identified taxa associated with B. burgdorferi infection that 
should be evaluated for their role in vector colonization by pathogens.

The interaction of house dust mites (HDM) and microorganisms is the key factor 
in the survival of these mites in human-made environments. Spent growth medium 
(SPGM) provides the rest of the diet, along with dead mite bodies and 
microorganisms. SPGM represents a source of microorganisms for the 
recolonization of mite food and the mite digestive tract. An experiment was 
performed to observe how adding SPGM to the HDM diet affects HDM population 
growth, the microbiome composition and the microbial respiration in microcosms. 
We analyzed American house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) and European 
house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) originating from control diets 
and diets treated with an extract of SPGM from 1- and 3-month-old mite cultures. 
The microbiome was described using 16S and 18S barcode sequencing. The 
composition of the bacterial and fungal microbiomes differed between the HDM 
species, but the SPGM treatment influenced only the bacterial profile of D. 
farinae. In the D. farinae microbiome of specimens on SPGM-treated diets 
compared to those of the control situation, the Lactobacillus profile decreased, 
while the Cardinium, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, and Sphingomonas profiles 
increased. The addition of SPGM extract decreased the microbial respiration in 
the microcosms with and without mites in almost all cases. Adding SPGM did not 
influence the population growth of D. farinae, but it had a variable effect on 
D. pteronyssinus. The results indicated that the HDM are marginally influenced 
by the microorganisms in their feces.

The hindgut of the termite Reticulitermes flavipes harbors a complex symbiotic 
community consisting of protists, bacteria, and archaea. These symbionts aid in 
the digestion of lignocellulose from the termite's wood meal. Termite hindguts 
were sampled and the V4 hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced 
and analyzed from individual termites. The core microbiota of worker termites 
consisted of 69 OTUs at the 97% identity level, grouped into 16 taxa, and 
together accounted for 67.05% of the sequences from the bacterial community. The 
core was dominated by Treponema, which contained 36 different OTUs and accounted 
for ∼32% of the sequences, which suggests Treponema sp. have an important impact 
on the overall physiology in the hindgut. Bray-Curtis beta diversity metrics 
showed that hindgut samples from termites of the same colony were more similar 
to each other than to samples from other colonies despite possessing a core that 
accounted for the majority of the sequences. The specific tasks and dietary 
differences of the termite castes could have an effect on the composition of the 
microbial community. The hindgut microbiota of termites from the alate castes 
differed from the worker caste with significantly lower abundances of Treponema 
and Endomicrobia, which dominated the hindgut microbiota in workers and 
soldiers. Protist abundances were also quantified in the same samples using qPCR 
of the 18S rRNA gene. Parabasalia abundances dropped significantly in the winged 
alates and the Oxymonadida abundances dropped in both alate castes. These data 
suggest that the changes in diet or overall host physiology affected the protist 
and bacterial populations in the hindgut. The in-depth bacterial 
characterization and protist quantification in this study sheds light on the 
potential community dynamics within the R. flavipes hindgut and identified a 
large and complex core microbiota in termites obtained from multiple colonies 
and castes.

The majority of geomicrobiological research conducted on glacial systems to date 
has focused on glaciers that override primarily carbonate or granitic bedrock 
types, with little known of the processes that support microbial life in glacial 
systems overriding volcanic terrains (e.g., basalt or andesite). To better 
constrain the role of the supraglacial ecosystems in the carbon and nitrogen 
cycles, to gain insight into microbiome composition and function in alpine 
glacial systems overriding volcanic terrains, and to constrain potential 
elemental sequestration or release through weathering processes associated with 
snow algae communities, we examined the microbial community structure and 
primary productivity of snow algae communities on stratovolcanoes in the Cascade 
Range of the Pacific Northwest. Here, we present the first published values for 
carbon fixation rates of snow algae communities on glaciers in the Pacific 
Northwest. We observed varying levels of light-dependent carbon fixation on 
supraglacial and periglacial snowfields at Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, and North 
Sister. Recovery of abundant 18S rRNA transcripts affiliated with 
photoautotrophs and 16S rRNA transcripts affiliated with heterotrophic bacteria 
is consistent with previous studies indicating the majority of primary 
productivity on snow and ice can be attributed to photoautotrophs. In contrast 
to previous observations of glacial ecosystems, our geochemical, isotopic, and 
microcosm data suggest these assemblages are not limited by phosphorus or fixed 
nitrogen availability. Furthermore, our data indicate these snow algae 
communities actively sequester Fe, Mn, and P leached from minerals sourced from 
the local rocks. Our observations of light-dependent primary productivity on 
snow are consistent with similar studies in polar ecosystems; however, our data 
may suggest that DIC may be a limiting nutrient in contrast to phosphorus or 
fixed nitrogen as has been observed in other glacial ecosystems. Our data 
underscore the need for similar studies on glacier surfaces and seasonal 
snowfields to better constrain the role of local bedrock and nutrient delivery 
on carbon fixation and biogeochemical cycling in these ecosystems.

The burning of chemical weapons in the 1926-1928 period produced polluted 
technosols with elevated levels of arsenic, zinc, lead and copper. During an 
eight-month mesocosm experiment, these soils were submitted to two controlled 
environmental changes, namely the alternation of dry and water-saturated 
conditions and the addition of fragmented organic forest litter to the surface 
soil. We investigated, by sequencing the gene coding 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA, (1) 
the structure of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic community in this polluted 
technosol and (2) their response to the simulated environmental changes, in the 
four distinct layers of the mesocosm. In spite of the high concentrations of 
toxic elements, microbial diversity was found to be similar to that of 
non-polluted soils. The bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria, 
Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while the fungal community was dominated by 
Ascomicota. Amongst the most abundant bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units 
(OTUs), including Sphingomonas as a major genus, some were common to soil 
environments in general whereas a few, such as organisms related to 
Leptospirillum and Acidiferrobacter, seemed to be more specific to the 
geochemical context. Evolution of the microbial abundance and community 
structures shed light on modifications induced by water saturation and the 
addition of forest litter to the soil surface. Co-inertia analysis suggests a 
relationship between the physico-chemical parameters total organic carbon, Zn, 
NH4+ and As(III) concentrations and the bacterial community structure. Both 
these results imply that microbial community dynamics linked to environmental 
changes should be considered as factors influencing the behavior of toxic 
elements on former ammunition burning sites.

The Gulf of Naples is a dynamical area with intense exchanges between offshore 
oligotrophic and coastal eutrophic waters with frequent freshwater inputs. The 
Sarno River, one of the most polluted rivers in Europe, strongly contributes to 
the pollution of the area, discharging high amounts of heavy metals and organic 
wastes from heavily cultivated and industrial areas. This paper reports on the 
diversity and community structure of the marine residential Bacteria and Archaea 
of the Gulf of Naples in an area close to the river Sarno plume and investigates 
their small-scale taxonomic diversity and expression patterns as a proxy of 
potential metabolic activity using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. 
Bacteria and Archaea were mainly represented by marine clades, with only minor 
contributors from freshwater ones. The community was dominated by Alpha- and 
Gammaproteobacteria, of which Rhodospirillales, Pelagibacteriales, and 
Oceanospirilalles were most represented. However, Alteromonadales and 
Rhodobacterales were the most active, despite their relative lower abundance, 
suggesting that they are important for overall ecosystem functioning and 
nutrient cycling. Nitrification and a reversed form of dissimilatory sulfate 
reduction were the major metabolic processes found in the metatrascriptomes and 
were mainly associated to Nitrosopumilales and Pelagibacter, respectively. No 
clear indication of transcripts related to stress induced by heavy metals or 
organic pollutants was found. In general, despite the high loads of pollutants 
discharged continuously by the Sarno River, the microbial community did not show 
marks of stress-induced changes neither structural nor functional, thus 
suggesting that this river has little or no effect on the planktonic bacterial 
community of the Gulf of Naples.

Diverse microbial communities hosted by the model carnivorous pitcher plant 
Sarracenia purpurea: analysis of both bacterial and eukaryotic composition 
across distinct host plant populations.

BACKGROUND: The pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea supplements nutrient 
acquisition through carnivory, capturing insect prey which are digested by a 
food web community of eukaryotes and bacteria. While the food web invertebrates 
are well studied, and some recent studies have characterized bacteria, detailed 
genetic analysis of eukaryotic diversity is lacking. This study aimed to compare 
eukaryotic and bacterial composition and diversity of pitcher communities within 
and between populations of host plants in nearby but distinct wetland habitats, 
and to characterize microbial functions across populations and in comparison 
with another freshwater community.
METHODS: Pitcher fluid was sampled from the two wetlands, Cedarburg and Sapa 
Bogs, community DNA was extracted, and 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons were sequenced 
and data processed for community-level comparisons.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial diversity in the small pitcher volume rivaled 
that of larger aquatic communities. Between pitcher plant populations, several 
bacterial families (Kiloniellaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Xanthobacteraceae, 
Sanguibacteraceae, Oligoflexaceae, Nitrosomonadaceae, Chromatiaceae, 
Saprospiraceae) were significantly higher in one population. However, although 
predicted pitcher bacterial functions were distinct from other freshwater 
communities, especially for some amino acid metabolism, functions were similar 
across all the pitchers in the two populations. This suggests some functional 
redundancy among bacterial taxa, and that functions converge to achieve similar 
food web processes. The sequencing identified a previously under-appreciated 
high diversity of ciliates, Acari mites, fungi and flagellates in pitcher 
communities; the most abundant sequences from eukaryotic taxa were 
Oligohymenophorea ciliates, millipedes and Ichthyosporea flagellates. Two thirds 
of taxa were identified as food web inhabitants and less than one third as prey 
organisms. Although eukaryotic composition was not significantly different 
between populations, there were different species of core taxonomic groups 
present in different pitchers-these differences may be driven by wetland 
habitats providing different populations to colonize new pitchers. Eukaryotic 
composition was more variable than bacterial composition, and there was a poor 
relationship between bacterial and eukaryotic composition within individual 
pitchers, suggesting that colonization by eukaryotes may be more stochastic than 
for bacteria, and bacterial recruitment to pitchers may involve factors other 
than prey capture and colonization by eukaryotic food web inhabitants.

Diet is a primary driver of the composition of gut microbiota and is considered 
one of the main routes of microbial colonization. Prey identification is 
fundamental for correlating the diet with the presence of particular microbial 
groups. The present study examined how diet influenced the composition and 
function of the gut microbiota of the Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina 
richardii) in order to better understand the role of prey consumption in shaping 
its microbiota. This species is a good indicator of the quality of the local 
environment due to both its foraging and haul-out site fidelity. DNA was 
extracted from 20 fecal samples collected from five harbor seal colonies located 
in Baja California, Mexico. The V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified and 
sequenced using the Illumina technology. Results showed that the gut microbiota 
of the harbor seals was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes (37%), Bacteroidetes 
(26%) and Fusobacteria (26%) and revealed significant differences in its 
composition among the colonies. Funtional analysis using the PICRUSt software 
suggests a high number of pathways involved in the basal metabolism, such as 
those for carbohydrates (22%) and amino acids (20%), and those related to the 
degradation of persistent environmental pollutants. In addition, a DNA 
metabarcoding analysis of the same samples, via the amplification and sequencing 
of the mtRNA 16S and rRNA 18S genes, was used to identify the prey consumed by 
harbor seals revealing the consumption of prey with mainly demersal habits. 
Functional redundancy in the seal gut microbiota was observed, irrespective of 
diet or location. Our results indicate that the frequency of occurrence of 
specific prey in the harbor seal diet plays an important role in shaping the 
composition of the gut microbiota of harbor seals by influencing the relative 
abundance of specific groups of gut microorganisms. A significant relationship 
was found among diet, gut microbiota composition and OTUs assigned to a 
particular metabolic pathway.

In densely populated urban environments, the distribution of microbes and the 
drivers of microbial community assemblages are not well understood. In sprawling 
metropolitan habitats, the "urban microbiome" may represent a mix of 
human-associated and environmental taxa. Here we carried out a baseline study of 
automated teller machine (ATM) keypads in New York City (NYC). Our goal was to 
describe the biodiversity and biogeography of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
microbes in an urban setting while assessing the potential source of microbial 
assemblages on ATM keypads. Microbial swab samples were collected from three 
boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) during June and July 2014, followed 
by generation of Illumina MiSeq datasets for bacterial (16S rRNA) and eukaryotic 
(18S rRNA) marker genes. Downstream analysis was carried out in the QIIME 
pipeline, in conjunction with neighborhood metadata (ethnicity, population, age 
groups) from the NYC Open Data portal. Neither the 16S nor 18S rRNA datasets 
showed any clustering patterns related to geography or neighborhood 
demographics. Bacterial assemblages on ATM keypads were dominated by taxonomic 
groups known to be associated with human skin communities (Actinobacteria, 
Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria), although SourceTracker analysis 
was unable to identify the source habitat for the majority of taxa. Eukaryotic 
assemblages were dominated by fungal taxa as well as by a low-diversity protist 
community containing both free-living and potentially pathogenic taxa 
(Toxoplasma, Trichomonas). Our results suggest that ATM keypads amalgamate 
microbial assemblages from different sources, including the human microbiome, 
eukaryotic food species, and potentially novel extremophilic taxa adapted to air 
or surfaces in the built environment. DNA obtained from ATM keypads may thus 
provide a record of both human behavior and environmental sources of microbes. 
IMPORTANCE Automated teller machine (ATM) keypads represent a specific and 
unexplored microhabitat for microbial communities. Although the number of built 
environment and urban microbial ecology studies has expanded greatly in recent 
years, the majority of research to date has focused on mass transit systems, 
city soils, and plumbing and ventilation systems in buildings. ATM surfaces, 
potentially retaining microbial signatures of human inhabitants, including both 
commensal taxa and pathogens, are interesting from both a biodiversity 
perspective and a public health perspective. By focusing on ATM keypads in 
different geographic areas of New York City with distinct population 
demographics, we aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of both 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, thus making a unique contribution to the 
growing body of work focused on the "urban microbiome." In New York City, the 
surface area of urban surfaces in Manhattan far exceeds the geographic area of 
the island itself. We have only just begun to describe the vast array of 
microbial taxa that are likely to be present across diverse types of urban 
habitats.

Macroalgal life histories are complex, often involving the alternation of 
distinct free-living life history phases that differ in morphology, longevity 
and ploidy. The surfaces of marine macroalgae support diverse microbial 
biofilms, yet the degree of microbial variation between alternate phases is 
unknown. We quantified bacterial (16S rRNA gene) and microeukaryote (18S rRNA 
gene) communities on the surface of the common intertidal seaweed, Mastocarpus 
spp., which alternates between gametophyte (foliose, haploid) and sporophyte 
(encrusting, diploid) life history phases. A large portion (97%) of bacterial 
taxa on the surface Mastocarpus was also present in samples from the 
environment, indicating that macroalgal surface communities are largely 
assembled from the surrounding seawater. Still, changes in the relative 
abundance of bacterial taxa result in significantly different communities on 
alternate Mastocarpus life history phases, rocky substrate and seawater at all 
intertidal elevations. For microeukaryote assemblages, only high 
intertidal samples had significant differences between life history phases 
although sporophytes were not different from the rocky substrate at this 
elevation; gametophytes and sporophytes did not differ in microeukaryote 
communities in the mid and low zones. By sequencing three host genes, we 
identified three cryptic species of Mastocarpus in our data set, which co-occur 
in the mid-to-low intertidal zone. In these samples, M. alaskensis sporophytes 
harboured distinct bacterial communities compared 
to M. agardhii and M. intermedius sporophytes, which were not distinguishable. 
Conversely, microeukaryote communities did not differ among species.

RATIONALE: Microbiome studies typically focus on bacteria, but fungal species 
are common in many body sites and can have profound effects on the host. Wide 
gaps exist in the understanding of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) and its 
relationship to lung disease.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize the mycobiome at different respiratory tract levels 
in persons with and without HIV infection and in HIV-infected individuals with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Oral washes (OW), induced sputa (IS), and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) 
were collected from 56 participants. We performed 18S and internal transcribed 
spacer sequencing and used the neutral model to identify fungal species that are 
likely residents of the lung. We used ubiquity-ubiquity plots, random forest, 
logistic regression, and metastats to compare fungal communities by HIV status 
and presence of COPD.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mycobiomes of OW, IS, and BAL shared common 
organisms, but each also had distinct members. Candida was dominant in OW and 
IS, but BAL had 39 fungal species that were disproportionately more abundant 
than in the OW. Fungal communities in BAL differed significantly by HIV status 
and by COPD, with Pneumocystis jirovecii significantly overrepresented in both 
groups. Other fungal species were also identified as differing in HIV and COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically examined the respiratory tract mycobiome 
in a relatively large group. By identifying Pneumocystis and other fungal 
species as overrepresented in the lung in HIV and in COPD, it is the first to 
determine alterations in fungal communities associated with lung dysfunction 
and/or HIV, highlighting the clinical relevance of these findings. Clinical 
trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00870857).

Target-gene amplicon sequencing is the most exploited high-throughput sequencing 
application in microbial ecology. The targets are taxonomically relevant genes, 
with 16S rRNA being the gold standard for bacteria. As for fungi, the most 
commonly used target is the internal transcribed spacer (ITS). However, the 
uneven ITS length among species may promote preferential amplification and 
sequencing and incorrect estimation of their abundance. Therefore, the use of 
different targets is desirable. We evaluated the use of three different target 
amplicons for the characterization of fungal diversity. After an in silico 
primer evaluation, we compared three amplicons (the ITS1-ITS2 region [ITS1-2], 
18S ribosomal small subunit RNA, and the D1/D2 domain of the 26S ribosomal large 
subunit RNA), using biological samples and a mock community of common fungal 
species. All three targets allowed for accurate identification of the species 
present. Nevertheless, high heterogeneity in ITS1-2 length was found, and this 
caused an overestimation of the abundance of species with a shorter ITS, while 
both 18S and 26S amplicons allowed for more reliable quantification. We 
demonstrated that ITS1-2 amplicon sequencing, although widely used, may lead to 
an incorrect evaluation of fungal communities, and efforts should be made to 
promote the use of different targets in sequencing-based microbial ecology 
studies.IMPORTANCE Amplicon-sequencing approaches for fungi may rely on 
different targets affecting the diversity and abundance of the fungal species. 
An increasing number of studies will address fungal diversity by high-throughput 
amplicon sequencing. The description of the communities must be accurate and 
reliable in order to draw useful insights and to address both ecological and 
biological questions. By analyzing a mock community and several biological 
samples, we demonstrate that using different amplicon targets may change the 
results of fungal microbiota analysis, and we highlight how a careful choice of 
the target is fundamental for a thorough description of the fungal communities.

How much temporal recurrence is present in microbial assemblages is still an 
unanswered ecological question. Even though marked seasonal changes have been 
reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and 
seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial 
recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic 
community populating a long-term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA 
gene data from two organismal size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2-3 µm) and 
the nanoplankton (3-20 µm). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in 
particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically 
between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 
10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae or MALV-III 
presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13%-19% of the OTUs in 
both size fractions, accounting for ~40% of the relative abundance, featured 
recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links long-term whole community 
dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that 
recurrent and non-recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial 
assemblages.

The association between diet and the rumen microbiota for wild animals remains 
largely unexplored. Here, we explored this association using a combination of 
16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the prokaryote microbiota and 18S rRNA 
gene sequencing to determine the dietary components for wild roe deer. These 
analyses revealed a wide diversity of dietary components, with 
over-representation of Bacteroidetes for the diet-correlating bacteria. 
Ruminococcus, on the other hand, dominated the stable diet-independent part of 
the microbiota. Taken together, the combination of 16S and 18S rRNA gene 
analyses provide novel insight into rumen microbiota ecology.

BACKGROUND: Magnolia officinalis Rehd. et Wils, commonly called Houpo, has been 
used for thousands of years in China as a traditional herbal medicine. The 
primary processing of Houpo requires sweating treatment, which is a special 
drying process and is considered to be an essential embodiment of high quality 
and genuine medicinal materials. The sweating of Houpo leads to peculiar changes 
in the microbial community structure and the content of main active substances 
(magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine). Variation in the microbial 
community was considered the cause of the change in content of active substances 
of Houpo, although the microbial taxa responsible for the improvement of content 
remain unidentified.
METHODS: In this study, we used MiSeq high-throughput sequencing methods for 
partial bacterial 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequences to compare the bacterial 
and fungal community structures at different timepoints in the process of 
sweating. The content of the main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, 
syringin and magnoflorine) were determined by high-performance liquid 
chromatography analysis to evaluate the effects of sweating. UPLC-Q-Extractive 
Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-QE Orbitrap MS) was used to detection of 
differential metabolites of unsweated Houpo before and after co-culture with 
core bacterial solutions.
RESULTS: In this study, the total contents of magnolol (MG) and honokiol (HK) 
were significantly increased at 4 dp (dp for day PM sample), up to 3.75%, and 
the contents of syringin (SG) and magnoflorine (MF) were as high as 0.12% and 
0.06%, respectively. Bacterial abundance and diversity were higher in the early 
stage (0 day-2 da; da for day AM sample) than in the later stage (4-5 dp), while 
fungal abundance was more obvious in the later stage than in the early stage. 
Positive correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of 
Enterobacter (P < 0.05), Klebsiella (P < 0.05), Weissella (P < 0.05), Bacillus 
(P < 0.05) and Candida (P < 0.05) would be conducive to improving the quality of 
Houpo. Negative correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of 
Actinomycetospora, Singulisphaera, Mucilaginibacter, Deinococcus, Gemmatirosa, 
Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Hymenobacter, Halomonas and Capnobotryella could 
be a potential antagonist for the decrease in the quality of Houpo. After 
co-culture of single core strain and unsweated Houpo, there was no significant 
difference in the four main active components, but there were other metabolites 
with significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that sweating increased the content of the main 
active compounds, promoted the relative abundance of potentially beneficial 
microbes, decreased the abundance of potentially harmful microbes, the core 
functional genera group together, forming a core microbiome, these genera are 
dominant across the different stages of the sweating process and contribute to 
the quality development of the characteristics of Houpo. Meanwhile, this study 
presented a clear scope for potential beneficial microbes that improve the 
quality of Houpo.

BACKGROUND: The deep mechanisms (deterministic and/or stochastic processes) 
underlying community assembly are a central challenge in microbial ecology. 
However, the relative importance of these processes in shaping riverine 
microeukaryotic biogeography is still poorly understood. Here, we compared the 
spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic community using 
high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene and multivariate statistical 
analyses from a subtropical river during wet and dry seasons.
RESULTS: Our results provide the first description of biogeographical patterns 
of microeukaryotic communities in the Tingjiang River, the largest river in the 
west of Fujian province, southeastern China. The results showed that 
microeukaryotes from both wet and dry seasons exhibited contrasting community 
compositions, which might be owing to planktonic microeukaryotes having seasonal 
succession patterns. Further, all components of the microeukaryotic communities 
(including total, dominant, always rare, and conditionally rare taxa) exhibited 
a significant distance-decay pattern in both seasons, and these communities had 
a stronger distance-decay relationship during the dry season, especially for the 
conditionally rare taxa. Although several variables had a significant influence 
on the microeukaryotic communities, the environmental and spatial factors showed 
minor roles in shaping the communities. Importantly, these microeukaryotic 
communities were strongly driven by stochastic processes, with 89.9%, 88.5%, and 
89.6% of the community variation explained by neutral community model during 
wet, dry, and both seasons, respectively. The neutral community model also 
explained a large fraction of the community variation across different taxonomic 
groups and levels. Additionally, the microeukaryotic taxa, which were above and 
below the neutral prediction, were ecologically and taxonomically distinct 
groups, which might be interactively structured by deterministic and stochastic 
processes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that stochastic processes are sufficient in 
shaping substantial variation in river microeukaryotic metacommunity across 
different hydrographic regimes, thereby providing a better understanding of 
spatiotemporal patterns, processes, and mechanisms of microeukaryotic community 
in waters.

Dietary supplementation with linseed, saponins, and nitrate is a promising 
methane mitigation strategy in ruminant production. Here, we aimed to assess the 
effects of these additives on the rumen microbiota in order to understand 
underlying microbial mechanisms of methane abatement. Two 2-by-2 factorial 
design studies were conducted simultaneously, which also allowed us to make a 
broad-based assessment of microbial responses. Eight nonlactating cows were fed 
diets supplemented with linseed or saponin in order to decrease hydrogen 
production and nitrate to affect hydrogen consumption; also, combinations of 
linseed plus nitrate or saponin plus nitrate were used to explore the 
interaction between dietary treatments. Previous work assessed effects on 
methane and fermentation patterns. Rumen microbes were studied by sequencing 18S 
and 16S rRNA genes and ITS1 amplicons. Methanogen activity was monitored by 
following changes in mcrA transcript abundance. Nitrate fed alone or in 
combination in both studies dramatically affected the composition and structure 
of rumen microbiota, although impacts were more evident in one of the studies. 
Linseed moderately modified only bacterial community structure. Indicator 
operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis revealed that both linseed and nitrate 
reduced the relative abundance of hydrogen-producing Ruminococcaceae Linseed 
increased the proportion of bacteria known to reduce succinate to propionate, 
whereas nitrate supplementation increased nitrate-reducing bacteria and 
decreased the metabolic activity of rumen methanogens. Saponins had no effect on 
the microbiota. Inconsistency found between the two studies with nitrate 
supplementation could be explained by changes in microbial ecosystem functioning 
rather than changes in microbial community structure.IMPORTANCE This study aimed 
at identifying the microbial mechanisms of enteric methane mitigation when 
linseed, nitrate, and saponins were fed to nonlactating cows alone or in a 
combination. Hydrogen is a limiting factor in rumen methanogenesis. We 
hypothesized that linseed and saponins would affect hydrogen producers and 
nitrate would affect hydrogen consumption, leading to reduced methane production 
in the rumen. Contrary to what was predicted, both linseed and nitrate had a 
deleterious effect on hydrogen producers; linseed also redirected hydrogen 
consumption toward propionate production, whereas nitrate stimulated the growth 
of nitrate-reducing and, hence, hydrogen-consuming bacterial taxa. This novel 
knowledge of microbial mechanisms involved in rumen methanogenesis provides 
insights for the development and optimization of methane mitigation strategies.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data on potential dysbiosis of the airway 
microbiota in horses with asthma.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the respiratory microbiota of horses 
with moderate asthma is altered. Our objectives were (a) to quantify tracheal 
bacterial populations using culture and qPCR, (2) to compare aerobic culture and 
qPCR, and (c) to correlate bacterial populations with bronchoalveolar lavage 
fluid (BALF) cytology.
ANIMALS: Eighteen horses with moderate asthma from a hospital population and 10 
controls.
METHODS: Prospective case-control study. Aerobic culture was performed on 
tracheal aspirates, and streptococci, Pasteurella multocida, Chlamydophila spp., 
Mycoplasma spp., as well as 16S (bacterial) and 18S (fungal) rRNA subunits were 
quantified by qPCR.
RESULTS: Potential pathogens such as Streptococcus spp., Actinobacillus spp., 
and Pasteurellaceae were isolated from 8, 5, and 6 horses with asthma and 3, 0, 
and 2 controls, respectively. There was a positive correlation between 
Streptococcus spp. DNA and 16S rRNA gene (r ≥ 0.7, P ≤ 0.02 in both groups), but 
the overall bacterial load (16S) was lower in asthma (1.5 ± 1.3 versus 
2.5 ± 0.8 × 104 copy/μL, P < 0.05). There was no association between microbial 
populations and clinical signs, tracheal mucus or BALF inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study does not support that bacterial 
overgrowth is a common feature of chronic moderate asthma in horses. Lower 
bacterial load could suggest dysbiosis of the lower airways, either as a 
consequence of chronic inflammation or previous treatments, or as a perpetuating 
factor of inflammation.

Free-living amoebae (FLA) are protozoa that can be found in water networks where 
they prey on bacteria within biofilms. Most bacteria are digested rapidly by 
phagocytosis, however some are able to survive within amoebae and some are even 
able to multiply, as it is the case for Legionella pneumophila. These resisting 
bacteria are a potential health problem as they could also resist to macrophage 
phagocytosis. Several publications already reported intra-amoebal bacteria but 
the methods of identification did not allow metagenomic analysis and are partly 
based on co-culture with one selected amoebal strain. The aim of our study was 
to conduct a rRNA-targeted metagenomic analysis on amoebae and intra-amoebal 
bacteria found in drinking water network, to provide the first FLA microbiome in 
environmental strains. Three sites of a water network were sampled during four 
months. Culturable FLA were isolated and total DNA was prepared, allowing 
purification of both amoebal and bacterial DNA. Metagenomic studies were then 
conducted through 18S or 16S amplicons sequencing. Hartmannella was by far the 
most represented genus of FLA. Regarding intra-amoebal bacteria, 54 genera were 
identified, among which 21 were newly described intra-amoebal bacteria, 
underlying the power of our approach. There were high differences in bacterial 
diversity between the three sites. Several genera were highly represented and/or 
found at least in two sites, underlying that these bacteria could be able to 
multiply within FLA. Our method is therefore useful to identify FLA microbiome 
and could be applied to other networks to have a more comprehensive view of 
intra-amoebal diversity.

Due to climate change, sea ice experiences changes in terms of extent and 
physical properties. In order to understand how sea ice microbial communities 
are affected by changes in physicochemical properties of the ice, we used 
454-sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes to examine environmental control of 
microbial diversity and composition in Antarctic sea ice. We observed a high 
diversity and richness of bacteria, which were strongly negatively correlated 
with temperature and positively with brine salinity. We suggest that bacterial 
diversity in sea ice is mainly controlled by physicochemical properties of the 
ice, such as temperature and salinity, and that sea ice bacterial communities 
are sensitive to seasonal and environmental changes. For the first time in 
Antarctic interior sea ice, we observed a strong eukaryotic dominance of the 
dinoflagellate phylotype SL163A10, comprising 63% of the total sequences. This 
phylotype is known to be kleptoplastic and could be a significant primary 
producer in sea ice. We conclude that mixotrophic flagellates may play a greater 
role in the sea ice microbial ecosystem than previously believed, and not only 
during the polar night but also during summer when potential food sources are 
abundant.

Mussel biofiltration is a widely used approach for the mitigation of aquaculture 
water. In this study, we investigated the effect of mussel biofiltration on the 
communities of particle-associated bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes in a sea 
bass aquaculture in southern North Sea. We assessed the planktonic community 
changes before and after biofiltration based on the diversity of the 16S and 18S 
rRNA genes by using next generation sequencing technologies. Although there was 
no overall reduction in the operational taxonomic units (OTU) numbers between 
the control (no mussels) and the test (with mussels) tanks, a clear reduction in 
the relative abundance of the top three most dominant OTUs in every sampling 
time was observed, ranging between 2-28% and 16-82% for Bacteria and Eukarya, 
respectively. The bacterial community was dominated by OTUs related to 
phytoplankton blooms and/or high concentrations of detritus. Among the 
eukaryotes, several fungal and parasitic groups were found. Their relative 
abundance in most cases was also reduced from the control to the test tanks; a 
similar decreasing pattern was also observed for both major higher taxa and 
functional (trophic) groups. Overall, this study showed the effectiveness of 
mussel biofiltration on the decrease of microbiota abundance and diversity in 
seawater fueling fish farms.

BACKGROUND: Fungi are a diverse eukaryotic group of degraders, pathogens, and 
symbionts, with many lineages known only from DNA sequences in soil, sediments, 
air, and water.
RESULTS: We provide rough phylogenetic placement and principal niche analysis 
for >40 previously unrecognized fungal groups at the order and class level from 
global soil samples based on combined 18S (nSSU) and 28S (nLSU) rRNA gene 
sequences. Especially, Rozellomycota (Cryptomycota), Zygomycota s.lat, 
Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota are rich in novel fungal lineages, most of which 
exhibit distinct preferences for climate and soil pH.
CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers the great phylogenetic richness of previously 
unrecognized order- to phylum-level fungal lineages. Most of these rare groups 
are distributed in different ecosystems of the world but exhibit distinct 
ecological preferences for climate or soil pH. Across the fungal kingdom, 
tropical and non-tropical habitats are equally likely to harbor novel groups. We 
advocate that a combination of traditional and high-throughput sequencing 
methods enable efficient recovery and phylogenetic placement of such unknown 
taxonomic groups.

A microbial consortium was directly taken from activated sludge and was used to 
solubilize rock phosphates (RPs) in a lab-scale bioreactor in this study. 
Results showed that the microbial consortium could efficiently release soluble 
phosphorus (P) from the RPs, and during 30-day incubation, it grew well in the 
bioreactor and reduced the pH of the solutions. The biosolubilization process 
was also illustrated by the observation of scanning electron microscopy combined 
with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), which showed an obvious 
corrosion on the ore surfaces, and most elements were removed from the ore 
samples. The analysis of microbial community structure by Illumina 16S ribosomal 
RNA (rRNA) gene and 18S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing reflected different microbial 
diversity and richness in the solutions added with different ore samples. A 
lower richness and diversity of bacteria but a higher richness and diversity of 
fungi occurred in the solution added with ore sample 1 compared to that of in 
the solution added with ore sample 2. Alphaproteobacteria and Saccharomycetes 
were the dominating bacterial and fungal group, respectively, both in the 
solutions added with ore samples 1 and 2 at the class level. However, their 
abundances in the solution added with ore sample 1 were obviously lower than 
that in the solution added with ore sample 2. This study provides new insights 
into our understanding of the microbial community structure in the 
biosolubilization of RPs by a microbial consortium directly taken from activated 
sludge.

The structure of microbial communities in a typical Italian-style salami, 
including bacterial and fungal diversity, was investigated by high-throughput 
sequencing technology. A total of 6 phyla, 7 classes, 19 orders, 20 families and 
28 genera were obtained from 16S rDNA sequences, and a total of 2 phyla, 4 
classes, 4 orders, 5 families, 10 genera and 12 Species were obtained from 18S 
rDNA sequences. The core microbiota was composed of Staphylococcaceae, 
representing up to 97.52% of the total 16S rRNA, and Penicillium digitatum, 
accounting for 99.74% of the total classified 18S rRNA. Lactobacillales and 
Saccharomycetales were detected with a quite low proportion of 1.71 and 0.007%, 
respectively. This study contributes to the knowledge of the microbial diversity 
involved in salami and presents high-throughput sequencing as a useful tool to 
evaluate microbial diversity and monitor the food-borne pathogens in fermented 
sausage.

To study the stability and succession of sediment microbial and macrobenthic 
communities in response to anthropogenic disturbance, a time-series sampling was 
conducted before, during, and 1 year after dredging in the Guan River in 
Changzhou, China, which was performed with cutter suction dredgers from 10 April 
to 20 May 2014. The microbial communities were analyzed by sequencing bacterial 
16S rRNA and eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene amplicons with Illumina MiSeq, and the 
macrobenthic community was identified using a morphological approach 
simultaneously. The results indicated that dredging disturbance significantly 
altered the composition and structures of sediment communities. The succession 
rates of communities were estimated by comparing the slopes of time-decay 
relationships. The temporal turnover of microeukaryotes (w = 0.3251, P < 0.001 
[where w is a measure of the rate of log(species turnover) across log(time)]) 
was the highest, followed by that of bacteria (w = 0.2450, P < 0.001), and then 
macrobenthos (w = 0.1273, P < 0.001). During dredging, the alpha diversities of 
both bacterial and microeukaryotic communities were more resistant, but their 
beta diversities were less resistant than that of macrobenthos. After recovery 
for 1 year, all three sediment communities were not resilient and had reached an 
alternative state. The alterations in sediment community structure and stability 
resulted in functional changes in nitrogen and carbon cycling in sediments. 
Sediment pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and temperature were the most 
important factors influencing the stability of sediment communities and 
ecosystem multifunctionality. This study suggests that discordant temporal 
turnovers and nonresilience of sediment communities under dredging resulted in 
functional changes, which are important for predicting sediment ecosystem 
functions under anthropogenic disturbances.
IMPORTANCE: Understanding the temporal turnover and stability of biotic 
communities is crucial for predicting the responses of sediment ecosystems to 
dredging disturbance. Most studies to date focused on the bacterial or 
macrobenthic community, only at two discontinuous time points, before and after 
dredging, and hence, it was difficult to analyze the community succession. This 
study first compared the stabilities and temporal changes of sediment bacterial, 
microeukaryotic, and macrobenthic communities at a continuous time course. The 
results showed that discordant responses of the three communities are mainly 
related to their different biological inherent attributes, and sensitivities to 
sediment geochemical variables change with dredging, resulting in changes in 
sediment ecosystem multifunctionality.

Nowadays, there are a few steroid drugs or intermediates that have been obtained 
via the transformation of microorganisms, and many strains of transformed 
steroids have not been found yet. Therefore, it is very significant to screen 
for the strains that have the abilities to transform steroids to produce 
valuable products. This study has focused on the screen and identification of 
strains, the structural identification of converted products, and the 
optimization of transformation conditions, as well as the establishment of 
transformation systems. A soil microbiota was screened for strain involved in 
the biotransformation of steroids. A new isolate IS547 is capable of converting 
a variety of steroids (such as cholesterol, ergosterol, hydrocortisone, 
progesterone, pregnenolone, and 16,17-alpha-epoxypregnenolone). Based on the 18S 
rDNA gene sequence comparison, the isolate IS547 has been demonstrated to be 
very closely related to Cladosporium sp. genus. Present paper is the first 
report regarding the microbial transformation by Cladosporium sp. to produce 
active intermediates, which include 7-hydroxy cholesterol, 
20-droxyl-16α,17α-epoxypregna-4-dien-3-one, 7-ketocholesterol, and 
7-droxyl-16α,17α-epoxypregna-4-dien-3,20-dione. Under the optimum conditions, 
the yields of product 3 and product 4 were 20.58 and 17.42%, respectively, 
higher than that prior to the optimization. The transformation rate increased 
significantly under the optimum fermentation conditions. This study describes an 
efficient, rapid, and inexpensive biotransformation system for the production of 
active pharmaceutical intermediates.

We examined the dose-dependent effects of feeding lactating dairy cows a 
standard diet supplemented with monensin at 175, 368, or 518 mg cow-1 day-1 on 
the rumen microbiota. For each dosage, 3 animals were randomly assigned into 
groups and fed the same basal total mixed ration diet supplemented with 
monensin, at the respective dose. After 20 days, rumen samples were taken and 
the effect on the microbiota was examined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and 
qPCR. At the lowest dose no significant change in 16S rRNA gene sequences 
associated with any bacterial phyla was observed; however, at the medium and 
high dosages, we observed significant reductions in sequences associated with 
gram-positive bacteria and significant increases in those associated with 
gram-negative bacteria that were dosage dependent. All dosages reduced the 
levels of sequences associated with methanogenic archaea in the rumen, with the 
medium dosage showing the largest decline. No significant difference was 
observed for the 18S rRNA gene sequences associated with protozoa in any of the 
libraries. Our results indicate that with this diet the medium dosage of 
monensin was most efficacious for the reduction in methanogenic archaea in the 
rumen of lactating dairy.

The current trend in reducing the antibiotic usage in animal production imposes 
urgency in the identification of novel biocides. The essential oil carvacrol, 
for example, changes the morphology of the cell and acts against a variety of 
targets within the bacterial membranes and cytoplasm, and our in vitro results 
show that it reduces adhesion and invasion of chicken intestinal primary cells 
and also biofilm formation. A trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of 
dietary supplementation of carvacrol at four concentrations (0, 120, 200, and 
300 mg/kg of diet) on the performance of Lactobacillus spp., Escherichia coli, 
Campylobacter spp., and broilers. Each of the four diets was fed to three 
replicates/trial of 50 chicks each from day 0 to 35. Our results show that 
carvacrol linearly decreased feed intake, feed conversion rates and increased 
body weight at all levels of supplementation. Plate count analysis showed that 
Campylobacter spp. was only detected at 35 days in the treatment groups compared 
with the control group where the colonization occurred at 21 days. The absence 
of Campylobacter spp. at 21 days in the treatment groups was associated with a 
significant increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. Also, 
carvacrol was demonstrated to have a significant effect on E. coli numbers in 
the cecum of the treatment groups, at all supplementation levels. In conclusion, 
this study shows for the first time that at different concentrations, carvacrol 
can delay Campylobacter spp., colonization of chicken broilers, by inducing 
changes in gut microflora, and it demonstrates promise as an alternative to the 
use of antibiotics.

Stable isotope probing of microbial nucleic acids applied in the rhizosphere 
enables (a) the identification of the active microbial community involved in 
root exudate assimilation and those involved in soil organic matter degradation, 
and (b) the study of the impact of plants via root exudates on the in situ 
expression of microbial functions. By incubating plants under 13CO2, fresh 
carbon exuded by the plant will be labeled and hence the microbial community 
assimilating 13C-root exudates will incorporate 13C into their cellular 
macromolecules. Labeled DNA, RNA, and proteins can be used to identify 
microorganisms that assimilated the root exudates. We provide a step-by-step 
protocol on how to apply stable isotope probing of DNA and RNA in the plant 
rhizosphere to identify the active microbial communities and analyze their gene 
expression.

Macrorhabdus ornithogaster is an opportunistic yeast that colonizes the gastric 
mucosa of many avian species. Until now, no studies have focused on the 
influence of a gastric infection on the balance of the intestinal microbiota of 
birds. In this study, 44 faecal samples from individual canaries, with and 
without M. ornithogaster infection, were analysed. The detection of the yeast 
was evaluated by 18S rRNA PCR. In order to evaluate the impact of the 
Macrorhabdus infection on the bacterial communities, culture-independent 
methods, by the use of amplicon-based sequencing as well as 16S rRNA-DGGE, were 
adopted. The different health status of animals affected the relative abundance 
of the main OTUs, with a greater diversification of the gut microbiota in 
healthy animals compared to the infected. In particular, Lactococcus, 
Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Lachnospiraceae, Propionibacterium and Weissella 
were found to be characteristic of uninfected animals (FDR < 0.05), while 
Lactobacillus and Candidatus Arthromitus were characteristic of infected animals 
(FDR < 0.05). Both these taxa have been reported as immunostimulatory, involved 
in immunological disorders. In infected animals the inferred metagenome assessed 
by PICRUST clearly showed a positive correlation between the presence of M. 
ornithogaster and KEGG genes related to ether lipid metabolism, already reported 
to be immunostimulatory by activation of macrophages and to play a 
pathophysiological role in several immunological disorders. Finally, our results 
show an interaction between infection of the digestive tract and intestinal 
microbiota of pet birds and provide insight into the changing of the complex 
enteric bacterial community. HIGHLIGHTS Macrorabdus ornithogaster is a gastric 
yeast that colonizes a wide range of birds. Differences were found between 
infected and healthy animals in gut microbiota. Candidatus Arthromitus was 
closely associated with infected birds. M. ornithogaster can affect intestinal 
microbiota composition of canaries.

The abundance of fungi in a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating urban 
wastewater and experiencing seasonal foaming was assessed by quantitative PCR 
(qPCR), comparing three different sets of widely used universal fungal primers 
targeting the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit RNA, 18S-rDNA, (primers 
NS1-Fung and FungiQuant) or the internal transcribed spacer ITS2 (primers 
ITS3-ITS4). Fungi were a numerically important fraction of the MBR microbiota 
(≥106 18S-rDNA copies/L activated sludge), and occurred both in the aerated and 
anoxic bioreactors. The numbers of copies of fungal markers/L activated sludge 
calculated using the NS1-Fung or ITS3-ITS4 primer sets were up to 2 orders of 
magnitude higher than the quantifications based on the FungiQuant primers. 
Fungal 18S-rDNA counts derived from the FungiQuant primers decreased 
significantly during cold seasons, concurring with foaming episodes in the MBR. 
Redundancy analysis corroborated that temperature was the main factor driving 
fungi abundance, which was also favored by longer solid retention time (SRT), 
lower chemical oxygen demand/biochemical oxygen demand at 5 days (COD/BOD5) of 
influent water, and lower biomass accumulation in the MBR.

Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse habitats on Earth, but knowledge of 
their associated marinemicrobiome remains limited. To increase the understanding 
of the coral reef ecosystem in the lower Gulf of Thailand, this study utilized 
16S and 18S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing to identify the prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic microbiota present in the reef water at Kham Island, Trat province, 
Thailand (N6.97 E100.86). The obtained result was then compared with the 
published microbiota from different coral reef water and marine sites. The coral 
reefs at Kham Island are of the fringe type. The reefs remain preserved and 
abundant. The community similarity indices (i.e., Lennon similarity index, Yue & 
Clayton similarity index) indicated that the prokaryotic composition of Kham was 
closely related to that of Kra, another fringing reef site in the lower Gulf of 
Thailand, followed by coral reef water microbiota at GS048b (Cooks Bay, Fr. 
Polynesia), Palmyra (Northern Line Islands, United States) and GS108b (Coccos 
Keeling, Australia), respectively. Additionally, the microbial eukaryotic 
populations at Kham was analyzed and compared with the available database at 
Kra. Both eukaryotic microbiota, in summer and winter seasons, were correlated. 
An abundance of Dinophysis acuminata was noted in the summer season, in 
accordance with its reported cause of diarrhoeatic shellfish outbreak in the 
summer season elsewhere. The slightly lower biodiversity in Kham than at Kra 
might reflect the partly habitat difference due to coastal anthropogenic 
activities and minor water circulation, as Kham locates close to the mainland 
and is surrounded by islands (e.g., Chang and Kut islands). The global marine 
microbiota comparison suggested relatively similar microbial structures among 
coral sites irrespective of geographical location, supporting the importance of 
coral-associated marine microbiomes, and Spearman's correlation analysis between 
community membership and factors of shore distance and seawater temperature 
indicated potential correlation of these factors (p-values < 0.05) with Kham, 
Kra, and some other coral and coastal sites. Together, this study provided the 
second marine microbial database for the coral reef of the lower Gulf of 
Thailand, and a comparison of the coral-associated marine microbial diversity 
among global ocean sites.

Studies of the human microbiome frequently omit characterization of fungal 
communities (the mycobiome), which limits our ability to investigate how fungal 
communities influence human health. The internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) 
region of the eukaryotic ribosomal cluster has features allowing for wide 
taxonomic coverage and has been recognized as a suitable barcode region for 
species-level identification of fungal organisms. We developed custom ITS1 
primer sets using iterative alignment refinement. Primer performance was 
evaluated using in silico testing and experimental testing of fungal cultures 
and human samples. Using an expanded novel reference database, SIS 
(18S-ITS1-5.8S), the newly designed primers showed an average in silico 
taxonomic coverage of 79.9% ± 7.1% compared to a coverage of 44.6% ± 13.2% using 
previously published primers (P = 0.05). The newly described primer sets 
recovered an average of 21,830 ± 225 fungal reads from fungal isolate culture 
samples, whereas the previously published primers had an average of 3,305 ± 
1,621 reads (P = 0.03). Of note was an increase in the taxonomic coverage of the 
Candida genus, which went from a mean coverage of 59.5% ± 13% to 100.0% ± 0.0% 
(P = 0.0015) comparing the previously described primers to the new primers, 
respectively. The newly developed ITS1 primer sets significantly improve general 
taxonomic coverage of fungal communities infecting humans and increased read 
depth by an order of magnitude over the best-performing published primer set 
tested. The overall best-performing primer pair in terms of taxonomic coverage 
and read recovery, ITS1-30F/ITS1-217R, will aid in advancing research in the 
area of the human mycobiome. IMPORTANCE The mycobiome constitutes all the fungal 
organisms within an environment or biological niche. The fungi are eukaryotes, 
are extremely heterogeneous, and include yeasts and molds that colonize humans 
as part of the microbiome. In addition, fungi can also infect humans and cause 
disease. Characterization of the bacterial component of the microbiome was 
revolutionized by 16S rRNA gene fragment amplification, next-generation 
sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics pipelines. Characterization of the 
mycobiome has often not been included in microbiome studies because of 
limitations in amplification systems. This report revisited the selection of PCR 
primers that amplify the fungal ITS1 region. We have identified primers with 
superior identification of fungi present in the database. We have compared the 
new primer sets against those previously used in the literature and show a 
significant improvement in read count and taxon identification. These primers 
should facilitate the study of fungi in human physiology and disease states.

Microbial eukaryotes (protists) are important components of terrestrial and 
aquatic environments, as well as animal and human microbiomes. Their 
relationships with metazoa range from mutualistic to parasitic and zoonotic 
(i.e., transmissible between humans and animals). Despite their ecological 
importance, our knowledge of protists in urban environments lags behind that of 
bacteria, largely due to a lack of experimentally validated high-throughput 
protocols that produce accurate estimates of protist diversity while minimizing 
non-protist DNA representation. We optimized protocols for detecting zoonotic 
protists in raw sewage samples, with a focus on trichomonad taxa. First, we 
investigated the utility of two commonly used variable regions of the 18S rRNA 
marker gene, V4 and V9, by amplifying and Sanger sequencing 23 different 
eukaryotic species, including 16 protist species such as Cryptosporidium parvum, 
Giardia intestinalis, Toxoplasma gondii, and species of trichomonad. Next, we 
optimized wet-lab methods for sample processing and Illumina sequencing of both 
regions from raw sewage collected from a private apartment building in New York 
City. Our results show that both regions are effective at identifying several 
zoonotic protists that may be present in sewage. A combination of small 
extractions (1 mL volumes) performed on the same day as sample collection, and 
the incorporation of a vertebrate blocking primer, is ideal to detect protist 
taxa of interest and combat the effects of metazoan DNA. We expect that the 
robust, standardized methods presented in our workflow will be applicable to 
investigations of protists in other environmental samples, and will help 
facilitate large-scale investigations of protistan diversity.

BACKGROUND: Metagenomics experiments often make inferences about microbial 
communities by sequencing 16S and 18S rRNA, and taxonomic assignment is a 
fundamental step in such studies. This paper addresses the weaknesses in two 
types of metrics commonly used by previous studies for measuring the performance 
of existing taxonomic assignment methods: Sequence count based metrics and 
Binary error measurement. These metrics made performance evaluation results 
biased, less informative and mutually incomparable.
RESULTS: We investigated weaknesses in two types of metrics and proposed new 
performance metrics including Average Taxonomy Distance (ATD) and ATD_by_Taxa, 
together with the visualized ATD plot.
CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the evaluation results from four popular taxonomic 
assignment methods across three test data sets, we found the new metrics more 
robust, informative and comparable.

Generally, plant roots shape the rhizosphere fungal community but how individual 
plant genes involved in senescence affect this shaping is less studied. We used 
an early senescence leaf (esl) mutant rice and compared it with its isogenic 
wild type variety to evaluate the effect of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (VHA-A1) gene 
mutation on the rhizosphere fungal community structure and composition using a 
metagenomic pyrosequencing approach. The most predominate fungal phyla 
identified for both isogenic lines belonged to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and 
Glomeromycota, where Ascomycota were more prevalent in the esl mutant than the 
wild type variety. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed a significant 
rise in the richness of Cladosporium cladosporioides in esl mutant rice than the 
wild type variety. Correlation analysis revealed four most abundant genera 
identified for the esl mutant and their close association with yield and biomass 
decline, lipid peroxidation, lower root vitality, chlorophyll degradation and 
limited VHA activity. Higher K+ efflux, H+ and a lower Ca2+ influx was also 
observed in the esl mutant which could be the reason for abnormal functioning of 
mutant plants. These results illustrate that besides the well-known effect of 
senescence on plant physiology and yield decline, it can further shape the 
rhizosphere fungal community.

OBJECTIVES: The correlation between caries and the oral prevalence of Candida 
spp. in children is contradictory in literature. Thereby, authors focused on 
Candida albicans as the most isolated Candida species from the oral cavity. 
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare caries-free and 
caries-bearing children regarding their oral carriage of Candida spp.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six caries-free (CF group) and 26 caries-active 
children (CA group) were included into this study. Three different types of 
specimens were assessed, saliva and plaque, and in the case of caries, infected 
dentine samples were microbiologically analyzed for aerobic and anaerobic 
microorganisms and their counts. Special attention was given to the 
differentiation between C. albicans and Candida dubliniensis. Additionally, 
different biochemical tests, VITEK 2 (VITEK®2, bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, 
France) and 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing, were applied for 
identification.
RESULTS: The detection of C. albicans did not differ between the CF and CA 
groups. C. dubliniensis was never detected in any specimen of the CF group, but 
occurred in one quarter of the CA group (27 % in plaque, 23 % in saliva), thus 
leading to a statistically significant difference between the two groups 
(p < 0.05). In six of these cases, C. dubliniensis was detected concomitantly in 
saliva and plaque and once only in plaque. CA group harbored statistically more 
Streptococcus mutans than the control group revealing a correlation between S. 
mutans and C. dubliniensis regarding the caries group.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting a frequent detection of C. 
dubliniensis in caries-active children, which could have been underestimated so 
far due to difficulties in differentiation between this yeast species and C. 
albicans.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Microbiological diagnostic-especially of oral Candida 
species-is an important determinant for identifying etiological factors of 
dental caries in children.

Rhizosphere and root-associated microbial communities are known to be related to 
soil-borne disease and plant health. In the present study, the microbial 
communities in rhizosphere soils and roots of both healthy and diseased Panax 
notoginseng were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA for bacteria 
and 18S rRNA internal transcribed spacer for fungi, to reveal the relationship 
of microbial community structure with plant health status. In total, 5593 
bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 963 fungal OTUs were identified 
in rhizosphere soils, while 1794 bacterial and 314 fungal OTUs were identified 
from root samples respectively. Principal coordinate analysis separated the 
microbial communities both in the rhizosphere soils and roots of diseased P. 
notoginseng from healthy plants. Compared to those of healthy P. notoginseng, 
microbial communities in rhizosphere soils and roots of diseased plants showed a 
decrease in alpha diversity. By contrast, bacterial community dissimilarity 
increased and fungal community dissimilarity decreased in rhizosphere soils of 
diseased plants, while both bacterial and fungal community dissimilarity in 
roots showed no significant difference between healthy and diseased plants. 
Redundancy analysis at the phylum level showed that mycorrhizal colonization and 
soil texture significantly affected microbial community composition in 
rhizosphere soils, whereas shoot nutrition status had a significant effect on 
microbial community composition in root samples. Our study provided strong 
evidence for the hypothesis that microbial diversity could potentially serve as 
an indicator for disease outbreak of medicinal plants, and supported the 
ecological significance of microbial communities in maintaining plant healthy 
and soil fertility.

Research on host-associated microbiomes has highlighted major divisions between 
the role of eukaryotes in free-living and symbiont systems. These trends call 
into question the relevance of macroecological processes to host-associated 
systems and the relative importance of parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism 
as evolutionary patterns across the domains of life. However, it is unclear as 
to whether these apparent differences reflect biological realities or 
methodologies in community characterization: free-living eukaryotes tend to be 
characterized using metabarcoding whereas symbiont eukaryotes are typically 
characterized with microscopy. Here, we utilize an Illumina high-throughput 
metabarcoding approach to characterize the diversity and dynamics of eukaryotic 
symbiont communities in the feces of a wild non-human primate, Macaca 
fascicularis, revealing functionally and taxonomically diverse communities of 
eukaryotes hitherto unreported from any vertebrate. Importantly, community 
assembly was consistent with top-down and bottom-up trophic food web dynamics, 
highlighting the applicability of macroecological principles to these 
communities. Ultimately, our findings highlight vertebrate-associated symbiont 
communities of the gut that are much more similar to free-living systems than 
previously realized. Additionally, our results support a role for symbiosis as a 
major recurrent life strategy among eukaryotes and highlight the potential for 
vertebrates to host vast reservoirs of unexplored eukaryotic diversity.

As groundwater-fed waterworks clean their raw inlet water with sand filters, a 
variety of pro- and eukaryotic microbial communities develop on these filters. 
While several studies have targeted the prokaryotic sand filter communities, 
little is known about the eukaryotic communities, despite the obvious need for 
knowledge of microorganisms that get in contact with human drinking water. With 
a new general eukaryotic primer set (18S, V1-V3 region), we performed FLX-454 
sequencing of material from 21 waterworks' sand filters varying in age (3-40 
years) and geographical location on a 250 km east-west axis in Denmark, and put 
the data in context of their previously published prokaryotic communities. We 
find that filters vary highly in trophic complexity depending on age, from 
simple systems with bacteria and protozoa (3-6 years) to complex, mature systems 
with nematodes, rotifers and turbellarians as apex predators (40 years). Unlike 
the bacterial communities, the eukaryotic communities display a clear 
distance-decay relationship that predominates over environmental variations, 
indicating that the underlying aquifers feeding the filters harbor distinct 
eukaryotic communities with limited dispersal in between. Our findings have 
implications for waterworks' filter management, and offer a window down to the 
largely unexplored eukaryotic microbiology of groundwater aquifers.

Intensive farming practices that implement deep and frequent tillage, high input 
inorganic fertilization, cultivation with non-host species, and pesticide use 
are widely reported to be detrimental for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), 
which are one of the most important plant biofertilizers. The effect of the 
reduction of agricultural input on AMF community dynamics following conversion 
from conventional non-mycorrhizal to lower input mycorrhizal crop cultivation 
has not yet been fully elucidated. We investigated the effect of the reduction 
of agricultural input, rotation, and season on AMF communities in winter wheat 
field soil after conversion from long-term (more than 20 years) non-mycorrhizal 
(sugar beet) crop cultivation. We described AMF communities from bulk soil 
samples by specifically targeting the 18S ribosomal gene using a combination of 
AMF specific primers and 454 pyrosequencing. No effect was found after 3 years' 
reduction of agricultural input, and only marginal effects were due to rotation 
with specific crops preceding winter wheat. Instead, season and year of sampling 
had the most appreciable influence on the AMF community. We suggest that, after 
conversion from long-term non-mycorrhizal to mycorrhizal crop cultivation, AMF 
diversity is low if compared to similar agroecosystems. Seasonal and 
successional dynamics play an important role as determinants of community 
structure.

Limited information is currently available on the contribution of eukaryotes to 
the reactor performance of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Using high-throughput 
Illumina sequencing of 18S rRNA genes and microscopic observations, we 
investigated eukaryotic microbiomes in membrane-attached biofilms in MBRs 
treating piggery wastewater. Protozoa preying on bacteria were frequently 
detected under stable conditions when membrane clogging was suppressed. However, 
the eukaryotes preying upon protozoa became predominant in biofilms when 
membrane fouling rapidly progressed. We herein demonstrated that a comprehensive 
investigation of eukaryotic microbiomes using high-throughput sequencing 
contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology involved in 
wastewater treatment.

BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and pre-term birth are 
major adverse pregnancy outcomes. These complications are considerable 
contributors to fetal/maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. A significant 
proportion of these cases are thought to be due to dysfunction of the placenta. 
However, the underlying mechanisms of placental dysfunction are unclear. The aim 
of the present study was to investigate whether adverse pregnancy outcomes are 
associated with evidence of placental eukaryotic infection.
RESULTS: We modified the 18S Illumina Amplicon Protocol of the Earth Microbiome 
Project and made it capable of detecting just a single spiked-in genome copy of 
Plasmodium falciparum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or Toxoplasma gondii among more 
than 70,000 human cells. Using this method, we were unable to detect eukaryotic 
pathogens in placental biopsies in instances of adverse pregnancy outcome 
(n = 199) or in healthy controls (n = 99).
CONCLUSIONS: Eukaryotic infection of the placenta is not an underlying cause of 
the aforementioned pregnancy complications. Possible clinical applications for 
this non-targeted, yet extremely sensitive, eukaryotic screening method are 
manifest.

Global amphibian decline linked to fungal pathogens has galvanized research on 
applied amphibian conservation. Skin-associated bacterial communities of 
amphibians have been shown to mediate fungal skin infections and the development 
of probiotic treatments with antifungal bacteria has become an emergent area of 
research. While exploring the role of protective bacteria has been a primary 
focus for amphibian conservation, we aim to expand and study the other microbes 
present in amphibian skin communities including fungi and other 
micro-eukaryotes. Here, we characterize skin-associated bacteria and 
micro-eukaryotic diversity found across life stages of Cascades frog (Rana 
cascadae) and their associated aquatic environments using culture independent 
16S and 18S rRNA marker-gene sequencing. Individuals of various life stages of 
Cascades frogs were sampled from a population located in the Trinity Alps in 
Northern California during an epidemic of the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium 
dendrobatidis. We filtered the bacterial sequences against a published database 
of bacteria known to inhibit B. dendrobatidis in co-culture to estimate the 
proportion of the skin bacterial community that is likely to provide defense 
against B. dendrobatidis. Tadpoles had a significantly higher proportion of B. 
dendrobatidis-inhibitory bacterial sequence matches relative to subadult and 
adult Cascades frogs. We applied a network analysis to examine patterns of 
correlation between bacterial taxa and B. dendrobatidis, as well as 
micro-eukaryotic taxa and B. dendrobatidis. Combined with the published database 
of bacteria known to inhibit B. dendrobatidis, we used the network analysis to 
identify bacteria that negatively correlated with B. dendrobatidis and thus 
could be good probiotic candidates in the Cascades frog system.

Epilithic river biofilms are complex matrix-enclosed communities harboring a 
great diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. Interactions 
between these communities and the relative impacts of environmental factors on 
their compositions are poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the 
spatio-temporal variation in the diversity and composition of bacterial and 
microeukaryotic communities within biofilms in a French river. Significant 
changes were found in the composition of these microbial communities over the 
sampling period and between the upstream and downstream stations. In addition, 
the beta diversity of the bacterial community tended to decrease along the 
river, mostly as a result of turnover. These changes could be caused by the 
different water temperatures and geological and hydrological river contexts at 
the sampling sites (from karst landscape to river plain). Finally, our network 
analysis showed multiple correlations among dominant OTUs. Among them, negative 
correlations between Rhodobacteraceae and two other dominant groups of 
photosynthetic microorganisms (cyanobacteria and diatoms) were particularly 
interesting, which raises the question of what environmental factors trigger the 
changes occurring in benthic microbial photosynthetic communities.

The microbial diversity of Japanese- and Chinese-fermented soybean pastes was 
investigated using nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). 
Five Japanese-fermented soybean paste samples and three Chinese-fermented 
soybean paste samples were analyzed for bacteria and fungi. Extracted DNA was 
used as a template for PCR to amplify 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. The nearly 
complete 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes were amplified using universal primers, and 
the resulting products were subsequently used as a template in a nested PCR to 
obtain suitable fragments for DGGE. Tetragenococcus halophilus and 
Staphylococcus gallinarum were found to dominate the bacterial microbiota in 
Japanese samples, whereas Bacillus sp. was detected as the predominant species 
in Chinese samples. DGGE analysis of fungi in soybean pastes determined the 
presence of Aspergillus oryzae and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii in most of the 
Chinese and Japanese samples. Some differences were observed in the bacterial 
diversity of Japanese- and Chinese-fermented soybean pastes.

The evolution of sophisticated differentiations of the gastro-intestinal tract 
enabled herbivorous mammals to digest dietary cellulose and hemicellulose with 
the aid of a complex anaerobic microbiota. Distinctive symbiotic ciliates, which 
are unique to this habitat, are the largest representatives of this microbial 
community. Analyses of a total of 484 different 18S rRNA genes show that 
extremely complex, but related ciliate communities can occur in the rumen of 
cattle, sheep, goats and red deer (301 sequences). The communities in the 
hindgut of equids (Equus caballus, Equus quagga), and elephants (Elephas 
maximus, Loxodonta africanus; 162 sequences), which are clearly distinct from 
the ruminant ciliate biota, exhibit a much higher diversity than anticipated on 
the basis of their morphology. All these ciliates from the gastro-intestinal 
tract constitute a monophyletic group, which consists of two major taxa, i.e. 
Vestibuliferida and Entodiniomorphida. The ciliates from the evolutionarily 
older hindgut fermenters exhibit a clustering that is specific for higher taxa 
of their hosts, as extant species of horse and zebra on the one hand, and Africa 
and Indian elephant on the other hand, share related ciliates. The evolutionary 
younger ruminants altogether share the various entodiniomorphs and the 
vestibuliferids from ruminants.

The present study assesses the diversity and composition of sediment bacterial 
and microeukaryotic communities from deep-sea mud volcanoes (MVs) associated 
with strike-slip faults in the South-West Iberian Margin (SWIM). We used a 
16S/18S rRNA gene based pyrosequencing approach to characterize and correlate 
the sediment bacterial and microeukaryotic communities from MVs with differing 
gas seep regimes and from an additional site with no apparent seeping activity. 
In general, our results showed significant compositional changes of bacterial 
and microeukaryotic communities in sampling sites with different seepage 
regimes. Sediment bacterial communities were enriched with Methylococcales 
(putative methanotrophs) but had lower abundances of Rhodospirillales, 
Nitrospirales and SAR202 in the more active MVs. Within microeukaryotic 
communities, members of the Lobosa (lobose amoebae) were enriched in more active 
MVs. We also showed a strong correlation between Methylococcales populations and 
lobose amoeba in active MVs. This study provides baseline information on the 
diversity and composition of bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in 
deep-sea MVs associated with strike-slip faults.

The resident microbiota was analyzed in a mesophilic, continuously operating 
biogas plant predominantly utilizing food residues, stale bread, and other waste 
cosubstrates together with pig manure and maize silage. The dominating 
bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic community members were characterized by two 
different 16S/18S rRNA gene culture-independent approaches. Prokaryotic 16S rRNA 
gene and eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed and further 
analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), 16S/18S rRNA gene 
sequencing, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The most dominant bacteria 
belonged to the phyla Bacteriodetes, Chloroflexus, and Firmicutes. On the family 
level, the bacterial composition confirmed high differences among biogas plants 
studied so fare. In contrast, the methanogenic archaeal community was similar to 
that of other studied biogas plants. Furthermore, it was possible to identify 
fungi at the genus level, namely Saccharomyces and Mucor. Both genera, which are 
important for microbial degradation of complex compounds, were up to now not 
found in biogas plants. The results revealed their long-term presence as 
indicated by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The DGGE method 
confirmed that the main members of the microbial community were constantly 
present over more than one-year period.

Oral microbiota is one of the most complex and diverse microbial communities in 
the human body. In the present study, we aimed to characterize oral fungi 
biodiversity and stability over time in a group of healthy participants with 
good oral health. Oral health and oral fungal microbiota were evaluated in 40 
healthy individuals. A follow-up of 10 participants was carried out 28 weeks and 
30 weeks after the first sampling. Oral rinse was collected and incubated in a 
fungal selective medium at 25ºC and 37ºC for 7 days. Fungi were identified based 
on macro- and microscopic morphology. API/ID32C was used for yeast 
identification, and molecular techniques were used to identify the most 
prevalent nonidentified moulds, mainly by sequencing 18S and internally 
transcribed spacer regions. Moulds were recovered from all participants and 
yeast from 92.5%. The most frequently isolated fungi were Candida spp., 
Rhodotorula spp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp., and Cladosporium spp. The 
oral fungal community presented a high interindividual variability, but the 
frequency and quantification of each fungal taxon was constant over the 30-week 
observation period, showing a consistent intraindividual stability over time. 
The intraindividual stability opposed to interindividual variability may suggest 
a common and a variable group of fungi in the oral cavity.

We investigated the influence of host species on intestinal microbiota by 
comparing the gut bacterial community structure of four cohabitating freshwater 
fish larvae, silver carp, grass carp, bighead carp, and blunt snout bream, using 
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the amplified 16S and 18S rRNA 
genes. Similarity clustering indicated that the intestinal microbiota derived 
from these four fish species could be divided into four groups based on 16S rRNA 
gene similarity, whereas the eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes showed no distinct 
groups. The water sample from the shared environment contained microbiota of an 
independent group as indicated by both 16S and 18S rRNA genes segments. The 
bacterial community structures were visualized using rank-abundance plots fitted 
with linear regression models. Results showed that the intestinal bacterial 
evenness was significantly different between species (P<0.05) and between 
species and the water sample (P<0.01). Thirty-five relatively dominant bands in 
DGGE patterns were sequenced and grouped into five major taxa: Proteobacteria 
(26), Actinobacteria (5), Bacteroidetes (1), Firmicutes (2), and Cyanobacterial 
(1). Six eukaryotes were detected by sequencing 18S rRNA genes segments. The 
present study suggests that the intestines of the four fish larvae, although 
reared in the same environment, contained distinct bacterial populations, while 
intestinal eukaryotic microorganisms were almost identical.

Global climate change is having profound impacts on polar ice with changes in 
the duration and extent of both land-fast ice and drift ice, which is part of 
the polar ice pack. Sea ice is a distinct habitat and the morphologically 
identifiable sympagic community living within sea ice can be readily 
distinguished from pelagic species. Sympagic metazoa and diatoms have been 
studied extensively since they can be identified using microscopy techniques. 
However, non-diatom eukaryotic cells living in ice have received much less 
attention despite taxa such as the dinoflagellate Polarella and the cercozoan 
Cryothecomonas being isolated from sea ice. Other small flagellates have also 
been reported, suggesting complex microbial food webs. Since smaller flagellates 
are fragile, often poorly preserved, and are difficult for non-experts to 
identify, we applied high throughput tag sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S 
rRNA gene to investigate the eukaryotic microbiome within the ice. The sea ice 
communities were diverse (190 taxa) and included many heterotrophic and 
mixotrophic species. Dinoflagellates (43 taxa), diatoms (29 taxa) and cercozoans 
(12 taxa) accounted for ~80% of the sequences. The sympagic communities living 
within drift ice and land-fast ice harbored taxonomically distinct communities 
and we highlight specific taxa of dinoflagellates and diatoms that may be 
indicators of land-fast and drift ice.

This study determined the loading impacts of wood-based biochar on the 
eukaryotic community in three different soils (brown sandy loam-BSL, red loam-RL 
and a black clay loam-BCL) using a pot trial conducted over 10 months. Soil 
analysis and 18S rRNA gene sequencing performed using the Illumina MiSeq 
platform was carried out to evaluate the changes in eukaryotic community 
composition in relation to different added amounts of biochar. It was found that 
biochar addition had a negligible effect on diversity parameters in the brown 
sandy loam Kurosol (BSL) and red loam Dermosol (RL) soils. There were, however, 
significant changes in eukaryotic community composition of these biochar amended 
soils. These changes were most discernible in the lighter (low clay content) BSL 
soil for the fungal communities (F = 3.0106, p = 0.0003) present and also when 
total eukaryotes were considered (F = 2.3907, p = 0.0002). In this respect 
Glomeromycota seem to be slightly promoted in the lighter BSL soils, which might 
be due to increased soil porosity and soil chemical fertility. Clay rich BCL 
soil community structure correlated to a greater degree with soil chemistry 
influenced by biochar addition. The results showed that soil microeukaryotes 
were affected by short term carbon amendment, though to a limited extent. The 
limited effect of biochar loading rates on the soil microbiology could be due to 
the short incubation period, the lack of added fertiliser nutrients, and also 
the inherent stability of the soil eukaryotic community. The data suggested the 
impacts that were observed however included important plant symbiotic organisms. 
The results also imply biochar applications at different loading levels have 
differential effects on soil microeurokaryotes in relation to soil properties in 
particular clay content.

In this study, a culture-independent Illumina MiSeq sequencing strategy was 
applied to investigate the microbial communities colonizing the ancient painted 
sculptures of the Maijishan Grottoes, a famous World Cultural Heritage site 
listed by UNESCO in China. Four mixed samples were collected from Cave 4-4 of 
the Maijishan Grottoes, the so-called Upper Seven Buddha Pavilion, which was 
built during the Northern Zhou Dynasty (557-581AD). The 16/18S rRNA gene-based 
sequences revealed a rich bacterial diversity and a relatively low fungal 
abundance, including the bacterial groups Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and 
Verrucomicrobia and the fungal groups Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and 
Chytridiomycota. Among them, the bacteria genera of Pseudonocardia and 
Rubrobacter and unclassified fungi in the order of Capnodiales were dominant. 
The relative abundance of Pseudonocardia in the painted layer samples was higher 
than that in the dust sample, while Cyanobacteria dominated in the dust sample. 
Many of them have been discovered at other cultural heritage sites and 
associated with the biodeterioration of cultural relics. The presence and 
activity of these pioneering microorganisms may lead to an unexpected 
deterioration of the painted sculptures that are preserved in this heritage 
site. Thus, proper management strategies and potential risk monitoring should be 
used in the Maijishan Grottoes to improve the conservation of these precious 
painted sculptures.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the changes in the microbial community 
and biochemical properties of a traditional sweet paste during fermentation. 
PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed that 
Aspergillus oryzae was the predominant species in the koji (the fungal mixture), 
and the majority of the fungi isolated belonged to two Zygosaccharomyces species 
in the mash. The bacterial DGGE profiles revealed the presence of Bacillus 
subtilis during fermentation, and Lactobacillus acidipiscis, Lactobacillus 
pubuzihii, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus kloosi, and several uncultured 
bacteria were also detected in the mash after 14 days of main fermentation. 
Additionally, during main fermentation, amino-type nitrogen and total acid 
increased gradually to a maximum of 6.77 ± 0.25 g/kg and 19.10 ± 0.58 g/kg (30 
days) respectively, and the concentration of reducing sugar increased to 337.41 
± 3.99 g/kg (7 days). The 180-day fermented sweet paste contained 261.46 ± 19.49 
g/kg reducing sugar and its pH value remained at around 4.65. This study has 
used the PCR-DGGE technique to demonstrate the microbial community (including 
bacteria and fungi) in sweet paste and provides useful information (biochemical 
properties) about the assessment of the quality of sweet paste throughout 
fermentation.

To investigate the differences in the microbial community composition and 
assembly process in two lake zones (Meiliang Bay (MLB) and Xukou Bay (XKB) in 
Taihu Lake, China) with different nutrient loadings, water samples were 
collected. Both the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene for the bacterial community 
and the 18S rRNA gene for the microeukaryote community were investigated using 
the Illumina second-generation sequencing platform (2 × 250 paired-end). The 
results indicated that both the bacterioplankton and microeukaryote community 
composition derived from the two lake zones were significantly different. 
Significantly higher operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness (P < 0.01) and 
phylogenetic diversity (P < 0.05) were found for the bacterioplankton community 
of MLB. However, a comparable alpha diversity was found between the 
microeukaryote communities of MLB and XKB (P > 0.05). Environmental factors 
significantly affected the community compositions in XKB for both the 
bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes. However, they did not significantly 
influence the microbial community composition in MLB, except for a weak 
correlation between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the microeukaryote 
community. The microbial communities tended to be more phylogenetically 
clustered than expected by chance in the two lake zones. Moreover, the results 
of the phylogenetic structure suggest that deterministic processes played 
overwhelming roles in driving the assembly of both the bacterioplankton and 
microeukaryote community in XKB.

Vector-borne diseases are a major health burden, yet factors affecting their 
spread are only partially understood. For example, microbial symbionts can 
impact mosquito reproduction, survival, and vectorial capacity, and hence affect 
disease transmission. Nonetheless, current knowledge of mosquito-associated 
microbial communities is limited. To characterize the bacterial and eukaryotic 
microbial communities of multiple vector species collected from different 
habitat types in disease endemic areas, we employed next-generation 454 
pyrosequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon libraries, also known as 
metabarcoding. We investigated pooled whole adult mosquitoes of three medically 
important vectors, Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus, 
collected from different habitats across central Thailand where we previously 
characterized mosquito diversity. Our results indicate that diversity within the 
mosquito microbiota is low, with the majority of microbes assigned to one or a 
few taxa. Two of the most common eukaryotic and bacterial genera recovered 
(Ascogregarina and Wolbachia, respectively) are known mosquito endosymbionts 
with potentially parasitic and long evolutionary relationships with their hosts. 
Patterns of microbial composition and diversity appeared to differ by both 
vector species and habitat for a given species, although high variability 
between samples suggests a strong stochastic element to microbiota assembly. In 
general, our findings suggest that multiple factors, such as habitat condition 
and mosquito species identity, may influence overall microbial community 
composition, and thus provide a basis for further investigations into the 
interactions between vectors, their microbial communities, and human-impacted 
landscapes that may ultimately affect vector-borne disease risk.

Heterotrophic microalgae, capable of converting organic carbons to biofuel, as 
well as assimilating nutrients, have a great prospective in wastewater 
treatment. Meanwhile, the knowledge about heterotrophic microalgae is still far 
less than the autotrophic conterpart. Hence, in this study, 20 heterotrophic 
microalgal strains were isolated from a domestic wastewater treatment plant, and 
identified according to morphology and partial 18S and 23S rRNA gene sequences. 
Further, their biological traits were assessed in terms of N, P, TOC removal 
efficiencies, growth parameters, self-settleability and lipids production, 
expressed through a comprehensive selection index. By such, the optimal strains 
were chosen and applied back to treat the real wastewater, with or without 
pretreatment of sterilization. An organic-adaptable strain, i.e., Botryococcus 
sp. NJD-1, was ultimately recommended to achieve the concurrent biofuel 
production (up to 61.7% lipid content) and pollutants removal (up to 64.5%, 
89.8% and 67.9% for N, P and TOC) in pristine wastewater.

Biotic interactions dominate plankton communities, yet the microbial consortia 
associated with harmful algal blooms (HABs) have not been well-described. Here, 
high-throughput amplicon sequencing of ribosomal genes was used to quantify the 
dynamics of bacterial (16S) and phytoplankton assemblages (18S) associated with 
blooms and cultures of two harmful algae, Alexandrium fundyense and Dinophysis 
acuminata. Experiments were performed to assess changes in natural bacterial and 
phytoplankton communities in response to the filtrate from cultures of these two 
harmful algae. Analysis of prokaryotic sequences from ecosystems, experiments, 
and cultures revealed statistically unique bacterial associations with each HAB. 
The dinoflagellate, Alexandrium, was strongly associated with multiple genera of 
Flavobacteria including Owenweeksia spp., Maribacter spp., and individuals 
within the NS5 marine group. While Flavobacteria also dominated 
Dinophysis-associated communities, the relative abundance of Alteromonadales 
bacteria strongly co-varied with Dinophysis abundances during blooms and 
Ulvibacter spp. (Flavobacteriales) and Arenicella spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) 
were associated with cells in culture. Eukaryotic sequencing facilitated the 
discovery of the endosymbiotic, parasitic dinoflagellate, Amoebophrya spp., that 
had not been regionally described but represented up to 17% of sequences during 
Alexandrium blooms. The presence of Alexandrium in field samples and in 
experiments significantly altered the relative abundances of bacterial and 
phytoplankton by both suppressing and promoting different taxa, while this 
effect was weaker in Dinophysis. Experiments specifically revealed a negative 
feedback loop during blooms whereby Alexandrium filtrate promoted the abundance 
of the parasite, Amoebophrya spp. Collectively, this study demonstrates that 
HABs formed by Alexandrium and Dinophysis harbor unique prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic microbiomes that are likely to, in turn, influence the dynamics of 
these HABs.

"Vorarlberger Bergkäse" (VB) is an Austrian artisanal hard cheese produced from 
raw cow's milk. The composition of its rind microbiota and the changes in the 
microbial communities during ripening have not previously been investigated. 
This study used 16S and 18S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing to characterize the 
bacterial and fungal communities of seven pooled cheese rind samples taken in 
seven different ripening cellars of three Austrian dairy facilities. A total of 
408 clones for 16S and 322 clones for 18S rRNA gene libraries were used for 
taxonomic classification, revealing 39 bacterial and seven fungal operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs). Bacterial OTUs belonged to four different phyla. Most 
OTUs were affiliated to genera often found in cheese, including high numbers of 
coryneforms. The most abundant OTU from 16S rRNA gene libraries showed highest 
similarity to Halomonas. Young cheese rinds were dominated by Actinobacteria or 
Proteobacteria, particularly by Halomonas and Brevibacterium aurantiacum, while 
Staphyloccocus equorum was most abundant in old cheeses. The most abundant 18S 
rRNA OTU had highest similarity to the filamentous fungus Scopulariopsis 
brevicaulis. Pairwise correlation analyses revealed putative co-occurrences 
between a number of OTUs. It was possible to discriminate the different cheese 
rind microbiota at the community-level by facility affiliation and ripening 
time. This work provides insights into the microbial composition of VB cheese 
rinds and might allow the processing- and ripening conditions to be improved to 
enhance the quality of the product.

Snowmelt is a crucial period for alpine soil ecosystems, as it is related to 
inputs of nutrients, particulate matter and microorganisms to the underlying 
soil. Although snow-inhabiting microbial communities represent an important 
inoculum for soils, they have thus far received little attention. The 
distribution and structure of these microorganisms in the snowpack may be linked 
to the physical properties of the snowpack at snowmelt. Snow samples were taken 
from snow profiles at four sites (1930-2519 m a.s.l.) in the catchment of the 
Tiefengletscher, Canton Uri, Switzerland. Microbial (Archaea, Bacteria and 
Fungi) communities were investigated through T-RFLP profiling of the 16S and 18S 
rRNA genes, respectively. In parallel, we assessed physical and chemical 
parameters relevant to the understanding of melting processes. Along the snow 
profiles, density increased with depth due to compaction, while other 
physico-chemical parameters, such as temperature and concentrations of DOC and 
soluble ions, remained in the same range (e.g. <2 mg DOC L(-1), 5-30 μg NH4 
(+)-N L(-1)) in all samples at all sites. Along the snow profiles, no major 
change was observed either in cell abundance or in bacterial and fungal 
diversity. No Archaea could be detected in the snow. Microbial communities, 
however, differed significantly between sites. Our results show that meltwater 
rearranges soluble ions and microbial communities in the snowpack.

Increasing evidence has revealed a close interplay between the gut bacterial 
communities and host growth performance. However, until recently, studies 
generally ignored the contribution of eukaryotes, endobiotic organisms. To fill 
this gap, we used Illumina sequencing technology on eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene to 
compare the structures of gut eukaryotic communities among cohabitating 
retarded, overgrown, and normal shrimp obtained from identically managed ponds. 
Results showed that a significant difference between gut eukaryotic communities 
differed significantly between water and intestine and among three shrimp 
categories. Structural equation modeling revealed that changes in the gut 
eukaryotic community were positively related to digestive enzyme activities, 
which in turn influenced shrimp growth performance (λ = 0.97, P < 0.001). 
Overgrown shrimp exhibited a more complex and cooperative gut eukaryotic 
interspecies interaction than retarded and normal shrimp, which may facilitate 
their nutrient acquisition efficiency. Notably, the distribution of dominant 
eukaryotic genera and shifts in keystone species were closely concordant with 
shrimp growth performance. In summary, this study provides an integrated 
overview on direct roles of gut eukaryotic communities in shrimp growth 
performance instead of well-studied bacterial assembly.

BACKGROUND: Research to understand and control microbiological risks associated 
with the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has examined many 
environments in the farm to fork continuum. An important data gap however, that 
remains poorly studied is the baseline description of microflora that may be 
associated with plant anatomy either endemically or in response to environmental 
pressures. Specific anatomical niches of plants may contribute to persistence of 
human pathogens in agricultural environments in ways we have yet to describe. 
Tomatoes have been implicated in outbreaks of Salmonella at least 17 times 
during the years spanning 1990 to 2010. Our research seeks to provide a baseline 
description of the tomato microbiome and possibly identify whether or not there 
is something distinctive about tomatoes or their growing ecology that 
contributes to persistence of Salmonella in this important food crop.
RESULTS: DNA was recovered from washes of epiphytic surfaces of tomato 
anatomical organs; leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits of Solanum 
lycopersicum (BHN602), grown at a site in close proximity to commercial farms 
previously implicated in tomato-Salmonella outbreaks. DNA was amplified for 
targeted 16S and 18S rRNA genes and sheared for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. 
Amplicons and metagenomes were used to describe "native" bacterial microflora 
for diverse anatomical parts of Virginia-grown tomatoes.
CONCLUSIONS: Distinct groupings of microbial communities were associated with 
different tomato plant organs and a gradient of compositional similarity could 
be correlated to the distance of a given plant part from the soil. Unique 
bacterial phylotypes (at 95% identity) were associated with fruits and flowers 
of tomato plants. These include Microvirga, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, 
Brachybacterium, Rhizobiales, Paracocccus, Chryseomonas and Microbacterium. The 
most frequently observed bacterial taxa across aerial plant regions were 
Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas. Dominant fungal taxa that could be identified to 
genus with 18S amplicons included Hypocrea, Aureobasidium and Cryptococcus. No 
definitive presence of Salmonella could be confirmed in any of the plant 
samples, although 16S sequences suggested that closely related genera were 
present on leaves, fruits and roots.

Antarctic ice-covered lakes are exceptional sites for studying the ecology of 
aquatic fungi under conditions of minimal human disturbance. In this study, we 
explored the diversity and community composition of fungi in five permanently 
covered lake basins located in the Taylor and Miers Valleys of Antarctica. Based 
on analysis of the 18S rRNA sequences, we showed that fungal taxa represented 
between 0.93% and 60.32% of the eukaryotic sequences. Cryptomycota and 
Chytridiomycota dominated the fungal communities in all lakes; however, members 
of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, and Blastocladiomycota were also 
present. Of the 1313 fungal OTUs identified, the two most abundant, belonging to 
LKM11 and Chytridiaceae, comprised 74% of the sequences. Significant differences 
in the community structure were determined among lakes, water depths, habitat 
features (i.e., brackish vs. freshwaters), and nucleic acids (DNA vs. RNA), 
suggesting niche differentiation. Network analysis suggested the existence of 
strong relationships among specific fungal phylotypes as well as between fungi 
and other eukaryotes. This study sheds light on the biology and ecology of basal 
fungi in aquatic systems. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the 
predominance of early diverging lineages of fungi in pristine limnetic 
ecosystems, particularly of the enigmatic phylum Cryptomycota.

BACKGROUND: Canine babesiosis is an emerging or re-emerging disease caused by 
Babesia and Theileria protozoans, also called piroplasms, transmitted by Ixodid 
ticks. In Europe, four etiological agents have been identified to date, namely 
Babesia canis, B. vogeli, B. gibsoni and Theileria annae. France has a high 
prevalence of canine babesiosis and two tick species, Dermacentor reticulatus 
and Rhipicephalus sanguineus, are supposed to transmit B. canis and B. vogeli 
respectively. In southern France, where dog infections with B. vogeli were 
recently confirmed, no comprehensive study was performed to date on piroplasm 
species infecting dogs. Thus, a large scale survey involving veterinary clinics, 
kennels and tick collection from the environment was conducted from 2010 to 2012 
in this area.
RESULTS: From 2010 to 2012, 140 dog blood samples and 667 ticks were collected. 
All blood and a subset of ticks were screened for the presence of piroplasms by 
PCR amplification of 18S rDNA. B. vogeli, B. canis and T. annae were detected in 
13.6, 12.9 and 0.7 % dogs respectively. B. vogeli and B. canis were detected in 
10.5 % and in 1.6 % R. sanguineus ticks including 1.3 % co-infections. B. canis 
was the only species detected in D. reticulatus ticks (9.7 %). B. canis 
infections were only recorded in the southwest of France whereas B. vogeli was 
mainly found in the southeast. Finally, a significantly higher prevalence of B. 
vogeli infection was found in Gard compared to Corsica and Drôme regions, both 
in dogs (p < 0.002) and R. sanguineus ticks (p < 0.02) although R. sanguineus 
was the main ticks species removed from dogs in those three areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The survey confirmed the circulation of both B. canis and B. vogeli 
in dogs in southern France with differences in distribution probably linked to 
the distribution of their respective vectors. It also showed differences in 
prevalence of B. vogeli infection in areas similar in terms of risk of dogs 
infestation with R. sanguineus. Further studies focusing on genetic and 
microbiota of R. sanguineus ticks should be conducted to explore other 
biological interactions that may explain the differences observed.

Microbial enzymes during solid-state fermentation (SSF), which play important 
roles in the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and environmental fields, remain 
relatively unknown. In this work, the microbial communities and enzymes in SSF 
of Pu-erh tea, a well-known traditional Chinese tea, were investigated by 
integrated metagenomics/metaproteomics approach. The dominant bacteria and fungi 
were identified as Proteobacteria (48.42%) and Aspergillus (94.98%), through 
pyrosequencing-based analyses of the bacterial 16S and fungal 18S rRNA genes, 
respectively. In total, 335 proteins with at least two unique peptides were 
identified and classified into 28 Biological Processes and 35 Molecular Function 
categories using a metaproteomics analysis. The integration of metagenomics and 
metaproteomics data demonstrated that Aspergillus was dominant fungus and major 
host of identified proteins (50.45%). Enzymes involved in the degradation of the 
plant cell wall were identified and associated with the soft-rotting of tea 
leaves. Peroxiredoxins, catalase and peroxidases were associated with the 
oxidation of catechins. In conclusion, this work greatly advances our 
understanding of the SSF of Pu-erh tea and provides a powerful tool for studying 
SSF mechanisms, especially in relation to the microbial communities present.

The root-associated microbiome is a key determinant of pollutant degradation, 
soil nutrient availability and plant biomass productivity, but could not be 
examined in depth prior to recent advances in high-throughput sequencing. 
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form symbioses with the majority of vascular 
plants. They are known to enhance mineral uptake and promote plant growth and 
are postulated to influence the processes involved in phytoremediation. Amplicon 
sequencing approaches have previously shown that petroleum hydrocarbon pollutant 
(PHP) concentration strongly influences AMF community structure in in situ 
phytoremediation experiments. We examined how AMF communities and their 
spore-associated microbiomes were structured within the rhizosphere of three 
plant species growing spontaneously in three distinct waste decantation basins 
of a former petrochemical plant. Our results show that the AMF community was 
only affected by PHP concentrations, while the AMF-associated fungal and 
bacterial communities were significantly affected by both PHP concentrations and 
plant species identity. We also found that some AMF taxa were either positively 
or negatively correlated with some fungal and bacterial groups. Our results 
suggest that in addition to PHP concentrations and plant species identity, AMF 
community composition may also shape the community structure of bacteria and 
fungi associated with AMF spores.

    Curr Biol. 2014 Apr 14;24(8):R315-7.

BACKGROUND: Biological communities are normally composed of a few abundant and 
many rare species. This pattern is particularly prominent in microbial 
communities, in which most constituent taxa are usually extremely rare. Although 
abundant and rare subcommunities may present intrinsic characteristics that 
could be crucial for understanding community dynamics and ecosystem functioning, 
microbiologists normally do not differentiate between them. Here, we investigate 
abundant and rare subcommunities of marine microbial eukaryotes, a crucial group 
of organisms that remains among the least-explored biodiversity components of 
the biosphere. We surveyed surface waters of six separate coastal locations in 
Europe, independently considering the picoplankton, nanoplankton, and 
microplankton/mesoplankton organismal size fractions.
RESULTS: Deep Illumina sequencing of the 18S rRNA indicated that the abundant 
regional community was mostly structured by organismal size fraction, whereas 
the rare regional community was mainly structured by geographic origin. However, 
some abundant and rare taxa presented similar biogeography, pointing to 
spatiotemporal structure in the rare microeukaryote biosphere. Abundant and rare 
subcommunities presented regular proportions across samples, indicating similar 
species-abundance distributions despite taxonomic compositional variation. 
Several taxa were abundant in one location and rare in other locations, 
suggesting large oscillations in abundance. The substantial amount of 
metabolically active lineages found in the rare biosphere suggests that this 
subcommunity constitutes a diversity reservoir that can respond rapidly to 
environmental change.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that marine planktonic microeukaryote assemblages 
incorporate dynamic and metabolically active abundant and rare subcommunities, 
with contrasting structuring patterns but fairly regular proportions, across 
space and time.

Microbial diversity and abundance in bioaerosols of a coal mine were analyzed 
based on 454 pyrosequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A 
total of 37,191 high quality sequences were obtained and could be classified 
into 531, 1730 and 448 operational taxonomic units respectively for archaea, 
bacteria and fungi at 97% sequence similarity. The Shannon diversity index for 
archaea, bacteria and fungi was respectively 4.71, 6.29 and 3.86, indicating a 
high diversity in coal mine bioaerosols. Crenarchaeota, Proteobacteria and 
Ascomycota were the dominant phyla for archaea, bacteria and fungi, 
respectively. The concentrations of total archaea, bacteria and fungi were 
1.44×10(8), 1.02×10(8) and 9.60×10(4) cells/m3, respectively. Methanotrophs 
observed in bioaerosols suggested possible methane oxidation in the coal mine. 
The identified potential pathogens to coal miners, such as Acinetobacter 
schindleri, Aeromonas cavernicola, Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus 
penicillioides, Cladosporium cladosporioides, and Penicillium brevicompactum 
were also observed. This was the first investigation of microbial diversity and 
abundance in coal mine bioaerosols. The investigation of microbial communities 
would be favorable in promoting the progress of methane control based on 
microbial technique and concern on coal miners' health.

The dynamics of bacterial and eukaryotic community associated with each step of 
a water purification plant in China was investigated using 454 pyrosequencing 
and qPCR based approaches. Analysis of pyrosequencing revealed that a high 
degree diversity of bacterial and eukaryotic communities is present in the 
drinking water treatment process before sand filtration. In addition, the 
microbial compositions of the biofilm in the sand filters and those of the water 
of the putatively clear tanks were distinct, suggesting that sand filtration and 
chlorination treatments played primary roles in removing exposed microbial 
communities. Potential pathogens including Acinetobacter, Clostridium, 
Legionella, and Mycobacterium, co-occurred with protozoa such as Rhizopoda 
(Hartmannellidae), and fungi such as Penicillium and Aspergillus. Furthermore, 
this study supported the ideas based on molecular level that biofilm communities 
were different from those in corresponding water samples, and that the 
concentrations of Mycobacterium spp., Legionella spp., and Naegleria spp. in the 
water samples declined with each step of the water treatment process by qPCR. 
Overall, this study provides the first detailed evaluation of bacterial and 
eukaryotic diversity at each step of an individual potable water treatment 
process located in China.

BACKGROUND: Few studies describing eukaryotic communities in the human gut 
microbiota have been published. The objective of this study was to investigate 
comprehensively the repertoire of plant and fungal species in the gut microbiota 
of an obese patient.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A stool specimen was collected from a 
27-year-old Caucasian woman with a body mass index of 48.9 who was living in 
Marseille, France. Plant and fungal species were identified using a PCR-based 
method incorporating 25 primer pairs specific for each eukaryotic phylum and 
universal eukaryotic primers targeting 18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer 
(ITS) and a chloroplast gene. The PCR products amplified using these primers 
were cloned and sequenced. Three different culture media were used to isolate 
fungi, and these cultured fungi were further identified by ITS sequencing. A 
total of 37 eukaryotic species were identified, including a Diatoms 
(Blastocystis sp.) species, 18 plant species from the Streptophyta phylum and 18 
fungal species from the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Chytridiocomycota phyla. 
Cultures yielded 16 fungal species, while PCR-sequencing identified 7 fungal 
species. Of these 7 species of fungi, 5 were also identified by culture. 
Twenty-one eukaryotic species were discovered for the first time in human gut 
microbiota, including 8 fungi (Aspergillus flavipes, Beauveria bassiana, Isaria 
farinosa, Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium dipodomyicola, Penicillium 
camemberti, Climacocystis sp. and Malassezia restricta). Many fungal species 
apparently originated from food, as did 11 plant species. However, four plant 
species (Atractylodes japonica, Fibraurea tinctoria, Angelica anomala, Mitella 
nuda) are used as medicinal plants.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Investigating the eukaryotic components of gut 
microbiota may help us to understand their role in human health.

AIMS: To identify and compare microbiota in Chinese liquor Daqu, which were 
produced in the different regions using different production process.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The DNA exacted from Daqu samples was used as a template 
for PCR with universal primers of 16S rRNA, 26S rRNA and 18S rRNA, respectively. 
The amplicons were analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
(DGGE). It was observed that the bacterial DGGE profile indicated high diversity 
and predominance of lactic acid bacteria. The results showed that 
Saccharomycopsis fibuligera and Pichia anomal were dominant yeast species and 
that several non-Saccharomyces yeasts including Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, 
Debaryomyces hansenii, Issatchenkia orientalis and Trichosporon asahii were also 
detected. As for fungal DGGE, Aspergillus oryzae and Absidia blakesleeana were 
the most common species amongst different samples. Based on the DGGE analysis, a 
few differences in community structure were found between Daqu samples.
CONCLUSIONS: A variety of bacteria, yeast and moulds were identified in Daqu 
samples, in addition to the present knowledge obtained mainly through the 
traditional culture-dependent methods. Moreover, production temperature played a 
more decisive role on the formation of micro-organism composition in Daqu than 
geographical region.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PCR-DGGE technique was used in this study 
to fully observe and asses all microbial community (including bacteria, yeast 
and mould) in Chinese liquor Daqu for the first time and proved to be effective 
in profiling Daqu microbial diversity.

Reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination is frequently used for the production of 
high-quality water from tertiary treated wastewater (TTWW). However, the RO 
desalination process is often hampered by biofouling, including membrane 
conditioning, microbial adhesion, and biofilm growth. The vast majority of 
biofilm exploration concentrated on the role of bacteria in biofouling 
neglecting additional microbial contributors, i.e., fungi and archaea. To better 
understand the RO biofouling process, bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversity 
was characterized in a laboratory-scale RO desalination plant exploring the TTWW 
(RO feed), the RO membrane and the RO feed tube biofilms. We sequenced 77,400 
fragments of the ribosome small subunit-encoding gene (16S and 18S rRNA) to 
identify the microbial community members in these matrices. Our results suggest 
that the bacterial, archaeal but not fungal community significantly differ from 
the RO membrane biofouling layer to the feedwater and tube biofilm (P < 0.01). 
Moreover, the RO membrane supported a more diverse community compared to the 
communities monitored in the feedwater and the biofilm attached to the RO 
feedwater tube. The tube biofilm was dominated by Actinobacteria (91.2 ± 4.6%), 
while the Proteobacteria phylum dominated the feedwater and RO membrane (at 
relative abundance of 92.3 ± 4.4% and 71.5 ± 8.3%, respectively), albeit 
comprising different members. The archaea communities were dominated by 
Crenarchaeota (53.0 ± 6.9%, 32.5 ± 7.2% and 69%, respectively) and Euryarchaeota 
(43.3 ± 6.3%, 23.2 ± 4.8% and 24%, respectively) in all three matrices, though 
the communities' composition differed. But the fungal communities composition 
was similar in all matrices, dominated by Ascomycota (97.6 ± 2.7%). Our results 
suggest that the RO membrane is a selective surface, supporting unique 
bacterial, and to a lesser extent archaeal communities, yet it does not select 
for a fungal community.

Dr. Burk Dehority was an international expert on the classification and 
monoculture of ruminal ciliated protozoa. We have summarized many of the 
advancements in knowledge from his work but also in his scientific way of 
thinking about interactions of ruminal ciliates with the entire rumen microbial 
community and animal host. As a dedication to his legacy, an electronic library 
of high-resolution images and video footage catalogs numerous species and 
techniques involved in taxonomy, isolation, culture, and ecological assessment 
of ruminal ciliate species and communities. Considerable promise remains to 
adapt these landmark approaches to harness eukaryotic cell signaling technology 
with genomics and transcriptomics to assess cellular mechanisms regulating 
growth and responsiveness to ruminal environmental conditions. These 
technologies can be adapted to study how protozoa interact (both antagonism and 
mutualism) within the entire ruminal microbiota. Thus, advancements and 
limitations in approaches used are highlighted such that future research 
questions can be posed to study rumen protozoal contribution to ruminant 
nutrition and productivity.

Legionella pneumophila is a waterborne bacterium known for causing Legionnaires' 
Disease, a severe pneumonia. Cooling towers are a major source of outbreaks, 
since they provide ideal conditions for L. pneumophila growth and produce 
aerosols. In such systems, L. pneumophila typically grow inside protozoan hosts. 
Several abiotic factors such as water temperature, pipe material and 
disinfection regime affect the colonization of cooling towers by L. pneumophila. 
The local physical and biological factors promoting the growth of L. pneumophila 
in water systems and its spatial distribution are not well understood. 
Therefore, we built a lab-scale cooling tower to study the dynamics of L. 
pneumophila colonization in relationship to the resident microbiota and spatial 
distribution. The pilot was filled with water from an operating cooling tower 
harboring low levels of L. pneumophila. It was seeded with Vermamoeba 
vermiformis, a natural host of L. pneumophila, and then inoculated with L. 
pneumophila. After 92 days of operation, the pilot was disassembled, the water 
was collected, and biofilm was extracted from the pipes. The microbiome was 
studied using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing. The communities 
of the water and of the biofilm were highly dissimilar. The relative abundance 
of Legionella in water samples reached up to 11% whereas abundance in the 
biofilm was extremely low (≤0.5%). In contrast, the host cells were mainly 
present in the biofilm. This suggests that L. pneumophila grows in host cells 
associated with biofilm and is then released back into the water following host 
cell lysis. In addition, water temperature shaped the bacterial and eukaryotic 
community of the biofilm, indicating that different parts of the systems may 
have different effects on Legionella growth.

Free-living amoebae are protozoa ubiquitously found in water systems. They 
mainly feed on bacteria by phagocytosis, but some bacterial species are able to 
resist or even escape this lethal process. Among these amoeba resistant bacteria 
are numerous members of the genus Mycobacterium. Nontuberculous Mycobacteria 
(NTM) are opportunistic pathogens that share the same ecological niches as 
amoebae. While several studies have demonstrated the ability of these bacteria 
to colonise and persist within drinking water networks, there is also strong 
suspicion that mycobacteria could use amoebae as a vehicle for protection and 
even replication. We investigated here the presence of NTM and FLA on a drinking 
water network during an all year round sampling campaign. We observed that 87.6% 
of recovered amoebal cultures carried high numbers of NTM. Identification of 
these amoeba and mycobacteria strains indicated that the main genera found in 
drinking water networks, that is, Acanthamoeba, Vermamoeba, Echinamoeba, and 
Protacanthamoeba are able to carry and likely to allow replication of several 
environmental and potentially pathogenic mycobacteria including M. llatzerense 
and M. chelonae. Direct Sanger sequencing as well as pyrosequencing of 
environmental isolates demonstrated the frequent association of mycobacteria and 
FLA, as they are part of the most represented genera composing amoebae's 
microbiome. This is the first time that an association between FLA and NTM is 
observed in water networks, highlighting the importance of FLA in the ecology of 
NTM.

Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) is used for the treatment of organic solid 
waste. Clogging of filtration membrane pores, called membrane fouling, is one of 
the most serious issues for the sustainable operation of AnMBR. Although the 
physical and chemical mechanisms of the membrane fouling have been widely 
studied, the biological mechanisms are still unclear. The biofilm formation and 
development on the membrane might cause the membrane fouling. In this study, the 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiomes of the membrane-attached biofilms in an 
AnMBR treating a model slurry of organic solid waste were investigated by 
non-destructive microscopy and high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA 
genes. The non-destructive visualization indicated that the biofilm was layered 
with different structures. The lowermost residual fouling layer was mesh-like 
and composed of filamentous microorganisms, while the upper cake layer was 
mainly the non-dense and non-cell region. The principal coordinate and 
phylogenetic analyses of the sequence data showed that the biofilm microbiomes 
were different from the sludge. The lowermost layer consisted of operational 
taxonomic units that were related to Leptolinea tardivitalis and Methanosaeta 
concilii (9.53-10.07% and 1.14-1.64% of the total prokaryotes, respectively) and 
Geotrichum candidum (30.22-82.31% of the total eukaryotes), all of which 
exhibited the filamentous morphology. Moreover, the upper layer was inhabited by 
the presumably cake-degrading bacteria and predatory eukaryotes. The biofilm 
microbiome features were consistent with the microscope-visualized structure. 
These results demonstrated that the biofilm structure and microbiome were the 
layer specific, which provides better understanding of biological mechanisms of 
membrane fouling in the AnMBR.

This study aimed at understanding the extent of contamination by lactic acid 
bacteria (LAB) and yeasts from the house microbiotas during sourdough 
back-slopping. Besides sourdoughs, wall, air, storage box, dough mixer and flour 
of four bakeries were analyzed. Based on plate counts, LAB and yeasts dominated 
the house microbiota. Based on high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes, 
flour harbored the highest number of Firmicutes, but only few of them adapted to 
storage box, dough mixer and sourdough. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis showed 
the highest abundance in dough mixer and sourdoughs. Lactobacillus plantarum 
persisted only in storage box, dough mixer and sourdough of two bakeries. 
Weissella cibaria also showed higher adaptability in sourdough than in bakery 
equipment, suggesting that flour is the main origin of this species. Based on 
18S rRNA data, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the dominant yeast in house and 
sourdough microbiotas, excepted one bakery dominated by Kazachstania exigua. The 
results of this study suggest that the dominant species of sourdough LAB and 
yeasts dominated also the house microbiota.

Entamoeba gingivalis is considered an oral commensal but demonstrates a 
pathogenic potential associated with periodontal disease in immunocompromised 
individuals. Therefore, this study evaluated the occurrence, opportunistic 
conditions, and intraspecific genetic variability of E. gingivalis in 
HIV(+)/AIDS patients. Entamoeba gingivalis was studied using fresh examination 
(FE), culture, and PCR from bacterial plaque samples collected from 82 
HIV(+)/AIDS patients. Genetic characterization of the lower ribosomal subunit of 
region 18S (18S-SSU rRNA) was conducted in 9 positive samples using 
low-stringency single specific primer PCR (LSSP-PCR) and sequencing analysis. 
Entamoeba gingivalis was detected in 63.4% (52/82) of the samples. No 
association was detected between the presence of E. gingivalis and the CD4(+) 
lymphocyte count (≤200 cells/mm(3) (p = 0.912) or viral load (p = 0.429). The 
LSSP-PCR results helped group E. gingivalis populations into 2 polymorphic 
groups (68.3% similarity): group I, associated with 63.6% (7/11) of the samples, 
and group II, associated with 36.4% (4/11) of the samples, which shared 74% and 
83.7% similarity and association with C and E isolates from HIV(-) individuals, 
respectively. Sequencing of 4 samples demonstrated 99% identity with the 
reference strain ATCC 30927 and also showed 2 divergent clusters, similar to 
those detected by LSSP-PCR. Opportunistic behavior of E. gingivalis was not 
detected, which may be related to the use of highly active antiretroviral 
therapy by all HIV(+)/AIDS patients. The high occurrence of E. gingivalis in 
these patients can be influenced by multifactorial components not directly 
related to the CD4(+) lymphocyte counts, such as cholesterol and the oral 
microbiota host, which could mask the potential opportunistic ability of E. 
gingivalis. The identification of the 18S SSU-rRNA polymorphism by LSSP-PCR and 
sequencing analysis provides the first evidence of genetic variability in E. 
gingivalis isolated from HIV patients.

BACKGROUND: Methane represents 16 % of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions. It has been estimated that ruminant livestock produce ca. 29 % of 
this methane. As individual animals produce consistently different quantities of 
methane, understanding the basis for these differences may lead to new 
opportunities for mitigating ruminal methane emissions. Metagenomics is a 
powerful new tool for understanding the composition and function of complex 
microbial communities. Here we have applied metagenomics to the rumen microbial 
community to identify differences in the microbiota and metagenome that lead to 
high- and low-methane-emitting cattle phenotypes.
METHODS: Four pairs of beef cattle were selected for extreme high and low 
methane emissions from 72 animals, matched for breed (Aberdeen-Angus or Limousin 
cross) and diet (high or medium concentrate). Community analysis was carried out 
by qPCR of 16S and 18S rRNA genes and by alignment of Illumina HiSeq reads to 
the GREENGENES database. Total genomic reads were aligned to the KEGG genes 
databasefor functional analysis.
RESULTS: Deep sequencing produced on average 11.3 Gb per sample. 16S rRNA gene 
abundances indicated that archaea, predominantly Methanobrevibacter, were 2.5× 
more numerous (P = 0.026) in high emitters, whereas among bacteria 
Proteobacteria, predominantly Succinivibrionaceae, were 4-fold less abundant 
(2.7 vs. 11.2 %; P = 0.002). KEGG analysis revealed that archaeal genes leading 
directly or indirectly to methane production were 2.7-fold more abundant in high 
emitters. Genes less abundant in high emitters included acetate kinase, electron 
transport complex proteins RnfC and RnfD and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. 
Sequence data were assembled de novo and over 1.5 million proteins were 
annotated on the subsequent metagenome scaffolds. Less than half of the 
predicted genes matched matched a domain within Pfam. Amongst 2774 identified 
proteins of the 20 KEGG orthologues that correlated with methane emissions, only 
16 showed 100 % identity with a publicly available protein sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of archaeal genes in ruminal digesta correlated 
strongly with differing methane emissions from individual animals, a finding 
useful for genetic screening purposes. Lower emissions were accompanied by 
higher Succinovibrionaceae abundance and changes in acetate and hydrogen 
production leading to less methanogenesis, as similarly postulated for 
Australian macropods. Large numbers of predicted protein sequences differed 
between high- and low-methane-emitting cattle. Ninety-nine percent were unknown, 
indicating a fertile area for future exploitation.

OBJECTIVE: Altered bacterial diversity of the intestinal mucosa-associated 
microbiota may reflect the net influence of lifestyle factors associated with 
the development of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). While a reduced 
bacterial diversity has been reported in IBD, little is known about the fungal 
microbiota. The aim of this study was to carry out a systematic analysis of 
intestinal fungal microbiota in IBD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mucosa-associated fungal microbiota of 104 colonic 
biopsy tissues from 47 controls and 57 IBD patients was investigated using 
metagenomic 18S rDNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), clone 
libraries, sequencing, and in situ hybridization techniques.
RESULTS: Fungi-specific 18S rDNA signatures could be detected in all 104 
patients, accounting for only a small proportion of the intestinal microbiota 
(0.02% of the mucosal and 0.03% of the fecal microbiota). An overall fungal 
biodiversity of 43 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found in the 
clone libraries. The qualitative composition of fungal microbiota was different 
between patients with IBD and controls. The DGGE profiles showed a higher mean 
fungal diversity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in comparison with 
controls (10.8+/-3.1 versus 6.2+/-2.4 for CD, p <or= 0.001). No disease-specific 
fungal species were found in the CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) group.
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse fungal species are part of the normal enteric microbiota, 
but diversity is increased and composition of the fungal communities varies in 
IBD. Further work is needed to investigate whether the alteration of the fungal 
flora in IBD is secondary to an imbalanced bacterial microbiota or an 
independent etiologic factor.

AIMS: To investigate bacterial and fungal community structure during degradation 
of varying concentrations (0-5000 mg kg(-1) ) of the polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon (PAH) fluoranthene in the presence or absence of tomato plants.
METHOD AND RESULTS: Fluoranthene amended or unamended growing media, with or 
without a plant, were incubated in pots in a glasshouse for 30 days. 
Fluoranthene concentration was quantified using GC-FID, while bacterial and 
fungal community structure was investigated using trflp and arisa, respectively. 
The abundance of two ring hydroxylating dioxygenase genes was measured using 
qPCR. More fluoranthene was degraded in the presence of tomato plants at 500 and 
5000 mg fluoranthene kg(-1) (P < 0·001), and it had a toxic effect on plant 
growth. Bacterial and fungal community composition in the rhizosphere was 
significantly different from that in nonrhizospheric and unplanted samples. The 
influence of fluoranthene on bacterial communities overcame that of the plant 
root such that community composition in rhizosphere and planted nonrhizospheric 
samples was broadly similar when fluoranthene was present. PAH-RHDα-GP genes 
were more abundant than PAH-RHDα-GN genes in all treatments. PAH-RHDα-GN 
abundance was unaffected by either PAH concentration or growing medium type, 
while the abundance of PAH-RHDα-GP was greatest in the rhizosphere.
CONCLUSIONS: Plants promoted microbial growth and diversity and led to increases 
in abundance of Gram-positive dioxygenase genes, correlated with increased 
degradation of fluoranthene.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work contributes to knowledge in the 
broad area of biodegradation and also provides useful information for the design 
of future bioremediation strategies.

Fermentation, also known as aging, is vital for enhancing the quality of 
flue-cured tobacco leaves (FTLs). Aged FTLs demonstrate high-quality sensory 
characteristics, while unaged FTLs do not. Microbes play important roles in the 
FTL fermentation process. However, the eukaryotic microbial community diversity 
is poorly understood, as are microbial associations within FTLs. We aimed to 
characterize and compare the microbiota associated with two important 
categories, fresh and strong flavor style FTLs, and to reveal correlations 
between the microbial taxa within them. Based on 16S and 18S rRNA Illumina MiSeq 
sequencing, the community richness and diversity of prokaryotes were almost as 
high as that of eukaryotes. The dominant microbes of FTLs belonged to seven 
genera, including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Methylobacterium, Acinetobacter, 
Sphingomonas, Neophaeosphaeria, and Cladosporium, of the Proteobacteria, 
Firmicutes, and Ascomycota phyla. According to partial least square discriminant 
analysis (PLS-DA), Xanthomonas, Franconibacter, Massilia, Quadrisphaera, 
Staphylococcus, Cladosporium, Lodderomyces, Symmetrospora, Golovinomyces, and 
Dioszegia were significantly positively correlated with fresh flavor style FTLs, 
while Xenophilus, Fusarium, unclassified Ustilaginaceae, Tilletiopsis, 
Cryphonectria, Colletotrichum, and Cyanodermella were significantly positively 
correlated with strong flavor style FTLs. Network analysis identified seven 
hubs, Aureimonas, Kocuria, Massilia, Brachybacterium, Clostridium, Dietzia, and 
Vishniacozyma, that may play important roles in FTL ecosystem stability, which 
may be destroyed by Myrmecridium. FTL microbiota was found to be correlated with 
flavor style. Species present in lower numbers than the dominant microbes might 
be used as microbial markers to discriminate different flavor style samples and 
to stabilize FTL microbial communities. This research advances our understanding 
of FTL microbiota and describes a means of discriminating between fresh and 
strong flavor FTLs based on their respective stable microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Fungal load quantification is a critical component of fungal 
community analyses. Limitation of current approaches for quantifying the fungal 
component in the human microbiome suggests the need for new broad-coverage 
techniques.
METHODS: We analyzed 2,085 18S rRNA gene sequences from the SILVA database for 
assay design. We generated and quantified plasmid standards using a qPCR-based 
approach. We evaluated assay coverage against 4,968 sequences and performed 
assay validation following the Minimum Information for Publication of 
Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines.
RESULTS: We designed FungiQuant, a TaqMan® qPCR assay targeting a 351 bp region 
in the fungal 18S rRNA gene. Our in silico analysis showed that FungiQuant is a 
perfect sequence match to 90.0% of the 2,617 fungal species analyzed. We showed 
that FungiQuant's is 100% sensitive and its amplification efficiencies ranged 
from 76.3% to 114.5%, with r(2)-values of >0.99 against the 69 fungal species 
tested. Additionally, FungiQuant inter- and intra-run coefficients of variance 
ranged from <10% and <20%, respectively. We further showed that FungiQuant has a 
limit of quantification 25 copies and a limit of detection at 5 copies. Lastly, 
by comparing results from human-only background DNA with low-level fungal DNA, 
we showed that amplification in two or three of a FungiQuant performed in 
triplicate is statistically significant for true positive fungal detection.
CONCLUSIONS: FungiQuant has comprehensive coverage against diverse fungi and is 
a robust quantification and detection tool for delineating between true fungal 
detection and non-target human DNA.

Periphyton dominated by the cellulose-rich filamentous green alga Cladophora 
forms conspicuous growths along rocky marine and freshwater shorelines 
worldwide, providing habitat for diverse epibionts. Bacterial epibionts have 
been inferred to display diverse functions of biogeochemical significance: 
N-fixation and other redox reactions, phosphorus accumulation, and organic 
degradation. Here, we report taxonomic diversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
epibionts and diversity of genes associated with materials cycling in a 
Cladophora metagenome sampled from Lake Mendota, Dane Co., WI, USA, during the 
growing season of 2012. A total of 1,060 distinct 16S, 173 18S, and 351 28S rRNA 
operational taxonomic units, from which >220 genera or species of bacteria 
(~60), protists (~80), fungi (6), and microscopic metazoa (~80), were 
distinguished with the use of reference databases. We inferred the presence of 
several algal taxa generally associated with marine systems and detected Jaoa, a 
freshwater periphytic ulvophyte previously thought endemic to China. We 
identified six distinct nifH gene sequences marking nitrogen fixation, >25 
bacterial and eukaryotic cellulases relevant to sedimentary C-cycling and 
technological applications, and genes encoding enzymes in aerobic and anaerobic 
pathways for vitamin B12 biosynthesis. These results emphasize the importance of 
Cladophora in providing habitat for microscopic metazoa, fungi, protists, and 
bacteria that are often inconspicuous, yet play important roles in ecosystem 
biogeochemistry.

Advances in sequencing technologies continue to provide unprecedented 
opportunities to characterize microbial communities. For example, the Pacific 
Biosciences Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) platform has emerged as a unique 
approach harnessing DNA polymerase activity to sequence template molecules, 
enabling long reads at low costs. With the aim to simultaneously classify and 
enumerate in situ microbial populations, we developed a quantitative SMRT 
(qSMRT) approach that involves the addition of exogenous standards to quantify 
ribosomal amplicons derived from environmental samples. The V7-9 regions of 18S 
SSU rDNA were targeted and quantified from protistan community samples collected 
in the Ross Sea during the Austral summer of 2011. We used three standards of 
different length and optimized conditions to obtain accurate quantitative 
retrieval across the range of expected amplicon sizes, a necessary criterion for 
analyzing taxonomically diverse 18S rDNA molecules from natural environments. 
The ability to concurrently identify and quantify microorganisms in their 
natural environment makes qSMRT a powerful, rapid and cost-effective approach 
for defining ecosystem diversity and function.

Entamoeba gingivalis is a protozoan that resides in the oral cavity. Using 
molecular biology techniques, we identified a novel organism that shares the 
same ecological niche as E. gingivalis. To differentiate this organism from E. 
gingivalis, we named it "kamaktli variant." By sequencing the 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 
rRNA region, we demonstrated that kamaktli variant is 89% identical to E. 
gingivalis. To elucidate the relationship between kamaktli variant and E. 
gingivalis, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. Both taxa clustered in the 
same clade with high support, indicating that the amoebas are closely related 
(98/99/1.00, maximum parsimony/maximum likelihood/MrBayes, respectively). Given 
this information, we propose that these molecular differences between kamaktli 
variant and E. gingivalis ST1 are sufficient to distinguish them as independent 
subtypes, and we name the new subtype "E. gingivalis ST2, kamaktli variant."

The Um Alhool area in Qatar is a dynamic evaporative ecosystem that receives 
seawater from below as it is surrounded by sand dunes. We investigated the 
chemical composition, the microbial activity and biodiversity of the four main 
layers (L1-L4) in the photosynthetic mats. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration 
and distribution (measured by HPLC and hyperspectral imaging, respectively), the 
phycocyanin distribution (scanned with hyperspectral imaging), oxygenic 
photosynthesis (determined by microsensor), and the abundance of photosynthetic 
microorganisms (from 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing) decreased with depth in the 
euphotic layer (L1). Incident irradiance exponentially attenuated in the same 
zone reaching 1% at 1.7-mm depth. Proteobacteria dominated all layers of the mat 
(24%-42% of the identified bacteria). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria 
(dominated by Chloroflexus) were most abundant in the third red layer of the mat 
(L3), evidenced by the spectral signature of Bacteriochlorophyll as well as by 
sequencing. The deep, black layer (L4) was dominated by sulfate reducing 
bacteria belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria, which were responsible for high 
sulfate reduction rates (measured using 35S tracer). Members of Halobacteria 
were the dominant Archaea in all layers of the mat (92%-97%), whereas Nematodes 
were the main Eukaryotes (up to 87%). Primary productivity rates of Um Alhool 
mat were similar to those of other hypersaline microbial mats. However, sulfate 
reduction rates were relatively low, indicating that oxygenic respiration 
contributes more to organic material degradation than sulfate reduction, because 
of bioturbation. Although Um Alhool hypersaline mat is a nutrient-limited 
ecosystem, it is interestingly dynamic and phylogenetically highly diverse. All 
its components work in a highly efficient and synchronized way to compensate for 
the lack of nutrient supply provided during regular inundation periods.

OBJECTIVES: Some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection 
by sexually transmitted organisms. Prior work demonstrated that the vaginal 
microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial 
communities; 4 dominated by Lactobacillus species (L. iners, L. crispatus, L. 
gasseri, L. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (CST) IV) lacking 
significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of 
Atopobium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, and other 
taxa. We sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial 
composition and Trichomonas vaginalis.
METHODS: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 
women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. T. vaginalis screening was 
performed using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA and β-tubulin genes. Vaginal 
bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA 
genes. A panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype T. vaginalis. 
The association between vaginal microbiota and T. vaginalis was evaluated by 
exact logistic regression.
RESULTS: T. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). Of the 11 
T. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as CST-IV, 2 (18%) as 
communities dominated by L. iners, and 1 (9%) as L. crispatus-dominated (P = 
0.05). CST-IV microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of 
detecting T. vaginalis compared with women in the L. crispatus-dominated state 
(OR: 8.26, 95% CI: 1.07-372.65). Seven of the 11 T. vaginalis isolates were 
assigned to 2 genotypes.
CONCLUSION: T. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of 
low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of Mycoplasma, Parvimonas, 
Sneathia, and other anaerobes.

Modern intensive husbandry practices can create poor indoor air quality, with 
high levels of airborne dust, endotoxins, ammonia, and microorganisms. Air in a 
sow breeding barn was investigated to determine the biomass composition of 
bioaerosols using molecular methods supplemented with microscopic and 
cultivation-dependent approaches. A total of 2.7 ± 0.7 × 10(7)  bacterial 
cells m(-3) air and 1.2 ± 0.3 × 10(6)  fungi spores m(-3) were detected, 
corresponding to the fungal biovolume constituted 98% of the total microbial 
biovolume (fungal and bacterial). Fifty-two percent of all 
4',6-diamidino-2-phenyl indole-stained cells were detectable with fluorescence 
in situ hybridization (FISH) with a general bacterial probe mixture. 
Quantitative FISH of the bacterial consortium revealed Firmicutes as the 
dominant group with Streptococcus as the major genus, while Actinobacteria 
constituted 10% of the detectable bacteria. Additionally, the study revealed an 
abundant and diverse fungal community including species not previously found in 
similar environments. The most abundant fungal 18S rRNA gene clone sequences 
identified affiliated with the Aspergillus-Eurotium cluster, but among others, 
species of Wallemia, Mucorales, and Russulales were detected. For both fungi and 
anaerobic bacteria, a hitherto undescribed diversity was found in bioaerosols 
from a modern sow breeding barn, which potentially could create poor indoor air 
quality, although their effect on the health of farmworkers and stock still is 
not resolved.

Sponges host complex symbiotic communities, but to date, the whole picture of 
the metabolic potential of sponge microbiota remains unclear, particularly the 
difference between the shallow-water and deep-sea sponge holobionts. In this 
study, two completely different sponges, shallow-water sponge Theonella swinhoei 
from the South China Sea and deep-sea sponge Neamphius huxleyi from the Indian 
Ocean, were selected to compare their whole symbiotic communities and metabolic 
potential, particularly in element transformation. Phylogenetically diverse 
bacteria, archaea, fungi, and algae were detected in both shallow-water sponge 
T. swinhoei and deep-sea sponge N. huxleyi, and different microbial community 
structures were indicated between these two sponges. Metagenome-based gene 
abundance analysis indicated that, though the two sponge microbiota have similar 
core functions, they showed different potential strategies in detailed metabolic 
processes, e.g., in the transformation and utilization of carbon, nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and sulfur by corresponding microbial symbionts. This study provides 
insight into the putative metabolic potentials of the microbiota associated with 
the shallow-water and deep-sea sponges at the whole community level, extending 
our knowledge of the sponge microbiota's functions, the association of sponge- 
microbes, as well as the adaption of sponge microbiota to the marine 
environment.

Resin is a chemical and physical defensive barrier secreted by many plants, 
especially coniferous trees, with insecticidal and antimicrobial properties. The 
degradation of terpenes, the main components accounting for the toxicity of 
resin, is highly relevant for a vast range of biotechnological processes, 
including bioremediation. In the present work, we used a resin-based selective 
medium in order to study the resin-tolerant microbial communities associated 
with the galls formed by the moth Retinia resinella; as well as resin from Pinus 
sylvestris forests, one of the largest ecosystems on Earth and a yet-unexplored 
source of terpene-degrading microorganisms. The taxonomic and functional 
diversity of the cultivated, resin-tolerant fraction of the whole microbiota 
were unveiled by high-throughput sequencing, which resulted in the detection of 
more than 40 bacterial genera among the terpene-degrading microorganisms, and a 
range of genes involved in the degradation of different terpene families. We 
further characterized through culture-based approaches and transcriptome 
sequencing selected microbial strains, including Pseudomonas sp., the most 
abundant species in both environmental resin and R. resinella resin-rich galls, 
and three fungal species, and experimentally confirmed their ability to degrade 
resin and also other terpene-based compounds and, thus, their potential use in 
biotechnological applications involving terpene catabolism.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to understand the microbial community of 
intestinal contents and mucosal layer in the intestine of rainbow trout by means 
of culture-dependent conventional and independent molecular techniques.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one culturable microbial phylotypes, and 39 sequences 
from 16S rRNA and two from 18S rRNA genes, were retrieved. Aeromonadaceae, 
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae representatives were the dominant 
cultured bacteria. Genomic DNA isolated from intestinal contents and mucus was 
used to generate 104 random clones, which were grouped into 32 phylotypes at 99% 
minimum similarity, most of which were affiliated with Proteobacteria (>70% of 
the total). However, unlike library C (intestinal contents), the phyla 
Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria were not found in intestinal mucus (library M), 
indicating that the microbiota in the gut mucus was different from that of the 
intestinal contents. Twelve sequences were retrieved from denaturing gradient 
gel electrophoresis analysis, and dominant bands were mostly related to 
Clostridium.
CONCLUSIONS: Many novel sequences that have not been previously recognized as 
part of the intestinal flora of rainbow trout were retrieved.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fish gut harbours a larger bacterial 
diversity than previously recognized, and the diversity of gut mucus is 
different from that of intestinal contents.

AIM: To describe and compare the predominant bacterial and fungal species 
associated with gingivitis, periodontitis, and linear gingival erythema (LGE), 
in HIV positive subjects with different immune status.
METHODS: Viral loads and CD4 levels determined HIV disease status. From pooled 
subgingival plaque, 16S and 18S rDNA were cloned and sequenced to determine 
species identity.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine bacterial species were identified from 14 
subjects. Nearly half of the species were not cultivable. Notably, the classical 
putative periodontal pathogens, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis 
and Tannerella forsythia were below the limit of detection and were not 
detected. Species of Gemella, Dialister, Streptococcus and Veillonella were 
predominant. In one HIV positive subject with periodontitis and low viral load, 
Gemella morbillorum, a known opportunistic pathogen, constituted 84% of the 
clones. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the only fungal species detected in an LGE 
subject and in periodontitis subjects with high viral loads. In periodontitis 
patients with low viral loads, Candida albicans was predominant, while S. 
cerevisiae was only a minor component.
CONCLUSION: These case studies suggest that other bacterial species, rather than 
the classical periodontal pathogens, may be involved in periodontal diseases of 
subjects with HIV. These data are indicative of opportunistic infections in a 
highly susceptible immunocompromised host.

The diversity of endophytic microorganisms may change due to the genotype of the 
host plant and its phenological stage. In this study we evaluated the effect of 
phenological stage, transgenes and genetic composition of maize on endophytic 
bacterial and fungal communities. The maize populations were composed of a local 
variety named Rosado (RS) and three isogenic hybrids. One isogenic hybrid was 
not genetically modified (NGM). Another hybrid (Hx) contained the transgenes 
cry1F and pat (T1507 event), which provide resistance to insects of the order 
Lepidoptera and tolerance to the glufosinate-ammonium herbicide, respectively. 
The third hybrid (Hxrr) contained the transgene cp4 epsps (NK603 event) combined 
with the transgenes cry1F and pat (T1507 event), which allow tolerance to the 
Roundup Ready herbicide, besides the characteristics of Hx. Evaluation of the 
foliar tissue was done through PCR-DGGE analysis, with specific primers for 
bacteria and fungi within four phenological stages of maize. The endophytic 
bacteria were only clustered by phenological stages; the structure of the fungal 
community was clustered by maize genotypes in each phenological stage. The 
fungal community from the local variety RS was different from the three hybrids 
(NGM, Hx and Hxrr) within the four evaluated stages. In the reproductive stage, 
the fungal community from the two transgenic hybrids (Hx and Hxrr) were 
separated, and the Hxrr was different from NGM, in the two field experiments. 
This research study showed that the genetic composition of the maize 
populations, especially the presence of transgenes, is the determining factor 
for the changes detected in the endophytic fungal community of maize leaves.

BACKGROUND: Microbial eukaryotes represent an important component of the human 
gut microbiome, with different beneficial or harmful roles; some species are 
commensal or mutualistic, whereas others are opportunistic or parasitic. The 
diversity of eukaryotes inhabiting humans remains relatively unexplored because 
of either the low abundance of these organisms in human gut or because they have 
received limited attention from a whole-community perspective.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: In this study, a single fecal sample from a 
healthy African male was studied using both culture-dependent methods and 
extended molecular methods targeting the 18S rRNA and ITS sequences. Our results 
revealed that very few fungi, including Candida spp., Galactomyces spp., and 
Trichosporon asahii, could be isolated using culture-based methods. In contrast, 
a relatively a high number of eukaryotic species could be identified in this 
fecal sample when culture-independent methods based on various primer sets were 
used. A total of 27 species from one sample were found among the 977 analyzed 
clones. The clone libraries were dominated by fungi (716 clones/977, 73.3%), 
corresponding to 16 different species. In addition, 187 sequences out of 977 
(19.2%) corresponded to 9 different species of plants; 59 sequences (6%) 
belonged to other micro-eukaryotes in the gut, including Entamoeba hartmanni and 
Blastocystis sp; and only 15 clones/977 (1.5%) were related to human 18S rRNA 
sequences.
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed a complex eukaryotic community in the 
volunteer's gut, with fungi being the most abundant species in the stool sample. 
Larger investigations are needed to assess the generality of these results and 
to understand their roles in human health and disease.

Objective of this study was to assess the single or combined effect of a plant 
oil and a lignocellulosic waste, namely soybean oil (SO) and maize stalks (MS), 
respectively, on resident microbiota and bioremediation performances of a soil 
historically contaminated by medium to highly chlorinated PCBs. Higher 
concentrations of both biphenyl- and chlorobenzoate-degrading cultivable 
bacteria were found in the MS-amended microcosms (MSM) than the non amended or 
SO-amended ones after 30 d incubation at 28°C. Fungal growth, instead, was 
strikingly stimulated in the microcosms that had undergone concomitant MS and SO 
supplementation (MS-SOM). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses of 
16S and 18S rRNA genes showed that both amendments promoted a remarkable 
increase in both bacterial and fungal biodiversity. The abundances of 
biphenyl-2,3-dioxygenase (bph) and that of catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C230) genes 
in the non-amended contaminated soil were constant over time. Conversely, after 
60 d incubation, bph and C230 abundances increased 2.8- and 61-fold in the MSM, 
respectively, and, in the MS-SOM, 1.4- and 46-fold, respectively, with respect 
to the zero time point. Although the overall PCB removal was not positively 
affected by the amendments, the concomitant presence of both MS and SO led to 
significantly higher depletions of hexa-, hepta-, octa- and nona-chlorinated 
congeners than in the non-amended microcosms (i.e. 24.6, 22, 20.5 and 9.5%, 
versus 19.4, 16.4, 14.7 and 6.1%, respectively). In all microcosms, PCB 
degradation was negatively correlated with hydrophobicity, organic matter/water 
partition coefficient, molecular weight and extent of chlorination of the 
pollutants with the notable exception of the MS-SOM ones where such a 
relationship was less stringent.

Using populations of two sympatric Peromyscus species, we characterized the 
importance of the host species, physiology, environment, diet, and other factors 
in shaping the structure and dynamics of their gut microbiota. We performed a 
capture-mark-release experiment in which we obtained 16S rRNA gene sequence data 
from 49 animals at multiple time points. In addition, we performed 18S rRNA gene 
sequencing of the same samples to characterize the diet of each individual. Our 
analysis could not distinguish between the two species of Peromyscus on the 
basis of the structures of their microbiotas. However, we did observe a set of 
bacterial populations that were found in every animal. Most notable were 
abundant representatives of the genera Lactobacillus and Helicobacter. When we 
combined the 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequence analyses, we were unable to 
distinguish the communities on the basis of the animal's diet. Furthermore, 
there were no discernible differences in the structure of the gut communities 
based on the capture site or their developmental or physiological status. 
Finally, in contrast to humans, where each individual has a unique microbiota 
when sampled over years, among the animals captured in this study, the 
uniqueness of each microbiota was lost within a week of the original sampling. 
Wild populations provide an opportunity to study host-microbiota interactions as 
they originally evolved, and the ability to perform natural experiments will 
facilitate a greater understanding of the factors that shape the structure and 
function of the gut microbiota.

Deep sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified small subunit (16S 
or 18S) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes fragments is commonly employed to 
characterize the composition and structure of microbial communities. Preparing 
genomic DNA for sequencing of such gene fragments on Illumina sequencers can be 
performed in a straightforward, two-stage PCR method, described herein. The 
protocol described allows for up to 384 samples to be sequenced simultaneously, 
and provides great flexibility in choice of primers.

Small eukaryotes (0.2-20 μm cell-size) represent a significant fraction of the 
microbial plankton community in shelf waters of NW-Spain. The community 
composition of small eukaryotes living at the surface and at the base of the 
photic zone was analysed by means of 18S rDNA high-throughput sequencing on a 
circa-monthly basis over a 23 months period. Ostreococcus was the most abundant 
taxon in surface waters, showing marked peaks in read abundance in spring and 
late summer, while Syndiniales dominated at the base of the photic zone. A 
well-defined seasonal pattern of community composition, linked to the succession 
of the dominant taxa, was found in surface waters. Seasonality was less apparent 
at the base of the euphotic zone. Temporal changes in abiotic factors 
significantly correlated with changes in community composition in surface (r = 
0.71) and at the base of the photic zone (r = 0.38). Changes in community 
composition significantly correlated with changes in community function-related 
variables (including biomass, primary production and respiration) only in 
surface water (r = 0.36). Co-occurrence network analyses revealed 45 significant 
interspecies associations among the 50 most abundant taxa with highly connected 
OTUs belonging to cryptophyceans. The network topology, with small-world 
characteristics, suggests a stabilizing role of biotic interactions to 
environmental disturbance.

Scale insects, like other plant sap-consumers, are host to symbiotic 
microorganisms which provide them with the substances missing from their diet. 
In contrast to most scale insects, Kermes quercus (Linnaeus) was regarded as 
asymbiotic. Our histological and ultrastructural observations show that in the 
body of the feeding stages of K. quercus collected in two locations (Warsaw and 
Cracow), numerous yeast-like microorganisms occur. These microorganisms were 
localized in the cytoplasm of fat body cells. The yeast-like microorganisms were 
observed neither in other organs of the host insect nor in the eggs. These 
microorganisms did not cause any damage to the structure of the ovaries and the 
course of oogenesis of the host insect. The females infected by them produced 
about 1300 larvae. The lack of these microorganisms in the cytoplasm of eggs 
indicates that they are not transmitted transovarially from mother to offspring. 
Molecular analyses indicated that the microorganisms which reside in the body of 
K. quercus are closely related to the entomopathogenic fungi Cordyceps and 
Ophiocordyceps, which belong to the Sordariomycetes class within the Ascomycota. 
The role of yeast-like microorganisms to their host insects remains unknown; 
however, it has been suggested that they may represent newly acquired symbionts.

We combined microscopic and molecular methods to investigate fungal assemblages 
on alder leaf litter exposed in the benthic and hyporheic zones of five streams 
across a gradient of increasing acidification for 4 weeks. The results showed 
that acidification and elevated Al concentrations strongly depressed sporulating 
aquatic hyphomycetes diversity in both zones of streams, while fungal diversity 
assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) appeared unaffected. 
Clone library analyses revealed that fungal communities on leaves were dominated 
by members of Ascomycetes and to a lesser extent by Basidiomycetes and 
Chytridiomycetes. An important contribution of terrestrial fungi was observed in 
both zones of the most acidified stream and in the hyporheic zone of the 
reference circumneutral stream. The highest leaf breakdown rate was observed in 
the circumneutral stream and occurred in the presence of both the highest 
diversity of sporulating aquatic hyphomycetes and the highest contribution to 
clone libraries of sequences affiliated with aquatic hyphomycetes. Both methods 
underline the major role played by aquatic hyphomycetes in leaf decomposition 
process. Our findings also bring out new highlights on the identity of 
leaf-associated fungal communities and their responses to anthropogenic 
alteration of running water ecosystems.

Actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, and fungi form subaerial biofilm (SAB) 
that can lead to material deterioration on artistic stone and frescoes. In 
studying SAB on cultural heritage surfaces, a general approach is to combine 
microscopy observations and molecular analyses. Sampling of biofilm is performed 
using specific adhesive tape and sampling of SAB and the substrate with sterile 
scalpels and chisels. Biofilm observations are carried out using optical and 
scanning electron microscopy. Specific taxa and EPS in biofilm can be readily 
visualized by fluorochrome staining and subsequent observation using 
fluorescence or confocal laser scanning microscopy. The observation of cross 
sections containing both SAB and the substrate shows if biofilm has developed 
not only on the surface but also underneath. Following nucleic acid extraction, 
16S rRNA gene sequencing is used to identify bacterial taxa, while 18S rRNA gene 
and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis is used to study 
eukaryotic groups. In this chapter, we illustrate the protocols related to 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).

The association of phytoplankton with bacteria is ubiquitous in nature and the 
bacteria that associate with different phytoplankton species are very diverse. 
The influence of these bacteria in the physiology and ecology of the host and 
the evolutionary forces that shape the relationship are still not understood. In 
this study, we used the Pseudo-nitzschia-microbiota association to determine (1) 
if algal species with distinct domoic acid (DA) production are selection factors 
that structures the bacterial community, (2) if host-specificity and 
co-adaptation govern the association, (3) the functional roles of isolated 
member of microbiota on diatom-hosts fitness and (4) the influence of microbiota 
in changing the phenotype of the diatom hosts with regards to toxin production. 
Analysis of the pyrosequencing-derived 16S rDNA data suggests that the three 
tested species of Pseudo-nitzschia, which vary in toxin production, have 
phylogenetically distinct bacterial communities, and toxic Pseudo-nitzschia have 
lower microbial diversity than non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia. Transplant 
experiments showed that isolated members of the microbiota are mutualistic to 
their native hosts but some are commensal or parasitic to foreign hosts, hinting 
at co-evolution between partners. Moreover, Pseudo-nitzschia host can gain 
protection from algalytic bacteria by maintaining association with its 
microbiota. Pseudo-nitzschia also exhibit different phenotypic expression with 
regards to DA production, and this depends on the bacterial species with which 
the host associates. Hence, the influences of the microbiota on diatom host 
physiology should be considered when studying the biology and ecology of marine 
diatoms.

To understand the ecological impacts of the "Plastisphere", those microbes need 
to be identified that preferentially colonize and interact with synthetic 
polymer surfaces, as opposed to general surface colonizers. It was hypothesized 
that the microbial biofilm composition varies distinctly between different 
substrates. A long-term incubation experiment was conducted (15month) with nine 
different synthetic polymer films as substrate as well as glass using a natural 
seawater flow-through system. To identify colonizing microorganisms, 16S and 
18SrRNA gene tag sequencing was performed. The microbial biofilms of these 
diverse artificial surfaces were visualized via scanning electron microscopy. 
Biofilm communities attached to synthetic polymers are distinct from glass 
associated biofilms; apparently a more general marine biofilm core community 
serves as shared core among all synthetic polymers rather than a specific 
synthetic polymer community. Nevertheless, characteristic and discriminatory 
taxa of significantly different biofilm communities were identified, indicating 
their specificity to a given substrate.

Documenting the natural diversity of eukaryotic organisms in the nonhuman 
primate (NHP) gut is important for understanding the evolution of the mammalian 
gut microbiome, its role in digestion, health and disease, and the consequences 
of anthropogenic change on primate biology and conservation. Despite the 
ecological significance of gut-associated eukaryotes, little is known about the 
factors that influence their assembly and diversity in mammals. In this study, 
we used an 18S rRNA gene fragment metabarcoding approach to assess the 
eukaryotic assemblage of 62 individuals representing 16 NHP species. We find 
that cercopithecoids, and especially the cercopithecines, have substantially 
higher alpha diversity than other NHP groups. Gut-associated protists and 
nematodes are widespread among NHPs, consistent with their ancient association 
with NHP hosts. However, we do not find a consistent signal of phylosymbiosis or 
host-species specificity. Rather, gut eukaryotes are only weakly structured by 
primate phylogeny with minimal signal from diet, in contrast to previous reports 
of NHP gut bacteria. The results of this study indicate that gut-associated 
eukaryotes offer different information than gut-associated bacteria and add to 
our understanding of the structure of the gut microbiome.

This study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (DF) on 
fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of Hu sheep 
fed on high-forage diets. Two complementary feeding trials were conducted. In 
Trial 1, six Hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 
2 × 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g DF 
daily. Total DNA was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen 
microbes, respectively. Numbers of 16S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen 
methanogens and bacteria, and 18S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen 
protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time PCR, and expressed as 
proportion of total rumen bacteria 16S rDNA. Ruminal pH decreased in the DF 
group compared with the control (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids increased 
(P < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (P < 0.01). Addition of DF inhibited the 
growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid 
samples. Both Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations 
increased (P < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. Trial 2 was conducted to 
investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to DF. Three cannulated 
sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with 
supplementation of DF at a level of 20 g/day. Ruminal samples were collected 
every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. No 
effects of DF were observed on pH, acetate and butyrate (P > 0.05). Populations 
of methanogens and R. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (P < 0.001), 
whereas addition of DF stimulated the population of solid-associated Fibrobacter 
succinogenes. Population of R. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in 
fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control 
week in solid samples. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota 
after adding DF. Ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both 
the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to Prevotella-like bacteria, 
and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to Selenomonas dianae. Another 
15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. 
Thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to Clostridium sp., 
and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to Ruminococcus sp. In summary, 
the microorganisms positively responding to DF addition were the cellulolytic 
bacteria, R. albus, F. succinogenes and B. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic 
bacteria, B. fibrisolvens, P. ruminicola and Clostridium sp.

BACKGROUND: The interactions of specific fungal phylotypes with immune cells 
have been recently documented; however, little is known whether gut fungal 
microbiota is influenced by aberrant immune response in immunosuppressive state. 
This study aimed to define the biologic impact of lymphocyte depletion on gut 
fungal microbiota and their relationship.
METHODS: Fifteen male cynomolgus monkeys with CD52 antigen negative on 
erythrocytes were administered intravenously with a single dose (3.0 mg kg body 
weight) of alemtuzumab. Depletion and repopulation of circulating and mucosal 
lymphocytes were determined. The dynamic variations of intestinal fungal 
microbiota were characterized using 18S ribosomal DNA-based molecular 
techniques.
RESULTS: The fungal microbiota in colonal mucosa was perturbed during lymphocyte 
depletion, characterized by increased diversity and colonization of Candida 
albicans, Aspergillus clavatus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The diversity of 
the fecal fungal population decreased markedly after mucosal lymphocyte 
depletion, and specific fungal phylotypes, especially Candida albicans, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Botryotinia fuckeliana, were expanded (P<0.05). 
After reconstitution of mucosal lymphocytes, the composition and diversity of 
the gut fungal microbiota were both recovered. A close association of the 
community diversity and Candida albicans colonization with T lymphocyte subsets 
was also identified.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that mucosal lymphocyte depletion leads to 
the dysbiosis of gut fungal microbiota, suggesting its role in maintaining 
host-fungus homeostasis. The pathophysiologic consequences of this altered 
fungal colonization might provide novel clues to uncover the underlying 
mechanism of enteric fungal infection in immunosuppressive therapies.

The colourless mat covering organically enriched sediments underlying an 
intensive salmon farm in Estero Pichicolo, southern Chile, was surveyed by 
combined 454 PyroTag and conventional Sanger sequencing of 16S/18S ribosomal RNA 
genes for Bacteria and Eukarya. The mat was dominated by the sulphide-oxidizing 
bacteria (SOB) Candidatus Isobeggiatoa, Candidatus Parabeggiatoa and Arcobacter. 
By order of their abundances, sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were represented 
by diverse deltaproteobacterial Desulfobacteraceae, but also within 
Desulfobulbaceae, Desulfuromonadaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae. The eukaryotic 
PyroTags were dominated by polychaetes, copepods and nematodes, however, 
ciliated protozoans were highly abundant in microscopy observations, and were 
represented by the genera Condylostoma, Loxophyllum and Peritromus. Finally, the 
abundant Sulfurimonas/Sulfurovum also suggest the occurrence of zero-valence 
sulphur oxidation, probably derived from Beggiatoaceae as a result of 
bacteriovorus infaunal activity or generated as free S(0) by the Arcobacter 
bacteria. The survey suggests an intense and complex sulphur cycle within the 
surface of salmon-farm impacted sediments.

In this study, we enlarged our previous investigation focusing on the 
biodiversity of chlamydiae and amoebae in a drinking water treatment plant, by 
the inclusion of two additional plants and by searching also for the presence of 
legionellae and mycobacteria. Autochthonous amoebae were recovered onto 
non-nutritive agar, identified by 18S rRNA gene sequencing, and screened for the 
presence of bacterial endosymbionts. Bacteria were also searched for by 
Acanthamoeba co-culture. From a total of 125 samples, we recovered 38 amoebae, 
among which six harboured endosymbionts (three chlamydiae and three 
legionellae). In addition, we recovered by amoebal co-culture 11 chlamydiae, 36 
legionellae (no L. pneumophila), and 24 mycobacteria (all rapid-growers). Two 
plants presented a similar percentage of samples positive for chlamydiae (11%), 
mycobacteria (20%) and amoebae (27%), whereas in the third plant the number of 
recovered bacteria was almost twice higher. Each plant exhibited a relatively 
high specific microbiota. Amoebae were mainly represented by various Naegleria 
species, Acanthamoeba species and Hartmannella vermiformis. Parachlamydiaceae 
were the most abundant chlamydiae (8 strains in total), and in this study we 
recovered a new genus-level strain, along with new chlamydiae previously 
reported. Similarly, about 66% of the recovered legionellae and 47% of the 
isolated mycobacteria could represent new species. Our work highlighted a high 
species diversity among legionellae and mycobacteria, dominated by putative new 
species, and it confirmed the presence of chlamydiae in these artificial water 
systems.

The diversity of the fecal bacterial community and its relationship with the 
concentration of volatile fatty acids in the feces during subacute rumen 
acidosis in dairy cows.

BACKGROUND: Sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a well-recognized digestive 
disorder found in particular in well-managed dairy herds. SARA can result in 
increased flow of fermentable substrates to the hindgut, which can increase the 
production of volatile fatty acids, alter the structure of the microbial 
community, and have a negative effect on animal health and productivity. 
However, little is known about changes in the structure of the microbial 
community and its relationship with fatty acids during SARA. Four cannulated 
primiparous (60 to 90 day in milk) Holstein dairy cows were assigned to two 
diets in a 2 × 2 crossover experimental design. The diets contained (on a dry 
matter basis): 40% (control diet, COD) and 70% (SARA induction diet, SAID) 
concentrate feeds. Samples of ruminal fluid and feces were collected on day 12, 
15, 17 and 21 of the treatment period, and the pH was measured in the ruminal 
and fecal samples; the fecal microbiota was determined by pyrosequencing 
analysis of the V1-V3 region of amplified 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA).
RESULTS: SAID decreased ruminal and fecal pH and increased the propionate, 
butyrate and total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentration in feces when 
compared with the COD. A barcoded DNA pyrosequencing method was used to generate 
2116 16S operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A total of 11 phyla were observed, 
distributed amongst all cattle on both diets; however, only 5 phyla were 
observed in all animals regardless of dietary treatment, and considerable animal 
to animal variation was revealed. The average abundance and its range of the 5 
phyla were as follows: Firmicutes (63.7%, 29.1-84.1%), Proteobacteria (18.3%, 
3.4-46.9%), Actinobacteria (6.8%, 0.4-39.9%), Bacteroidetes (7.6%, 2.2-17.7%) 
and Tenericutes (1.6%, 0.3-3%). Feeding the SAID resulted in significant shifts 
in the structure of the fecal microbial community when compared with the 
traditional COD. Among the 2116 OTUs detected in the present study, 88 OTUs were 
affected significantly by diet; and the proportion of these OTUs was 20.6% and 
17.4% among the total number of sequences, respectively. Among the OTUs 
affected, the predominant species, including OTU2140 (G: Turicibacter), OTU1695 
(G: Stenotrophomonas) and OTU8143 (F: Lachnospiraceae), were increased, while 
the abundance of OTU1266 (S: Solibacillus silvestris) and OTU2022 (G: 
Lysinibacillus) was reduced in the SAID group compared with the COD. Further, 
our results indicated that the fecal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations 
were significantly related to presence of some certain species of Bacteroidetes 
and Firmicutes in the feces.
CONCLUSIONS: This is, to our knowledge, the first study that has used barcoded 
DNA pyrosequencing to survey the fecal microbiome of dairy cattle during SARA. 
Our results suggest that particular bacteria and their metabolites in the feces 
appear to contribute to differences in host health between those given SAID and 
traditional COD feeding. A better understanding of these microbial populations 
will allow for improved nutrient management and increased animal growth 
performance.

Thiocyanate (SCN-) forms as a by-product of cyanidation during gold ore 
processing and can be degraded by a variety of microorganisms utilizing it as an 
energy, nitrogen, sulphur and/or carbon source. In complex consortia inhabiting 
bioreactor systems, a range of metabolisms are sustained by SCN- degradation; 
however, despite the addition or presence of labile carbon sources in most 
bioreactor designs to date, autotrophic bacteria have been found to dominate key 
metabolic functions. In this study, we cultured an autotrophic SCN--degrading 
consortium directly from gold mine tailings. In a batch-mode bioreactor 
experiment, this consortium degraded 22 mM SCN-, accumulating ammonium (NH4+) 
and sulphate (SO42-) as the major end products. The consortium consisted of a 
diverse microbial community comprised of chemolithoautotrophic members, and 
despite the absence of an added organic carbon substrate, a significant 
population of heterotrophic bacteria. The role of eukaryotes in bioreactor 
systems is often poorly understood; however, we found their 18S rRNA genes to be 
most closely related to sequences from bacterivorous Amoebozoa. Through combined 
chemical and phylogenetic analyses, we were able to infer roles for key 
microbial consortium members during SCN- biodegradation. This study provides a 
basis for understanding the behaviour of a SCN- degrading bioreactor under 
autotrophic conditions, an anticipated approach to remediating SCN- at 
contemporary gold mines.

We investigated the interactions of air and snow over one entire winter 
accumulation period as well as the importance of chemical markers in a pristine 
free-tropospheric environment to explain variation in a microbiological dataset. 
To overcome the limitations of short term bioaerosol sampling, we sampled the 
atmosphere continuously onto quartzfiber air filters using a DIGITEL high volume 
PM10 sampler. The bacterial and fungal communities, sequenced using Illumina 
MiSeq, as well as the chemical components of the atmosphere were compared to 
those of a late season snow profile. Results reveal strong dynamics in the 
composition of bacterial and fungal communities in air and snow. In fall the two 
compartments were similar, suggesting a strong interaction between them. The 
overlap diminished as the season progressed due to an evolution within the 
snowpack throughout winter and spring. Certain bacterial and fungal genera were 
only detected in air samples, which implies that a distinct air microbiome might 
exist. These organisms are likely not incorporated in clouds and thus not 
precipitated or scavenged in snow. Although snow appears to be seeded by the 
atmosphere, both air and snow showed differing bacterial and fungal communities 
and chemical composition. Season and alpha diversity were major drivers for 
microbial variability in snow and air, and only a few chemical markers were 
identified as important in explaining microbial diversity. Air microbial 
community variation was more related to chemical markers than snow microbial 
composition. For air microbial communities Cl-, TC/OC, SO4 2-, Mg2+, and Fe/Al, 
all compounds related to dust or anthropogenic activities, were identified as 
related to bacterial variability while dust related Ca2+ was significant in 
snow. The only common driver for snow and air was SO4 2-, a tracer for 
anthropogenic sources. The occurrence of chemical compounds was coupled with 
boundary layer injections in the free troposphere (FT). Boundary layer 
injections also caused the observed variations in community composition and 
chemistry between the two compartments. Long-term monitoring is required for a 
more valid insight in post-depositional selection in snow.

Compared with the knowledge of sponge-associated bacterial diversity and 
ecological roles, the fungal diversity and ecological roles of sponges remain 
largely unknown. In this study, the fungal diversity and protein synthesis 
potential in two South China Sea sponges Theonella swinhoei and Xestospongia 
testudinaria were investigated by rRNA vs. rRNA gene analysis. EF4/fung5 was 
chosen after a series of PCR tests to target fungal 18S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene. 
Altogether, 283 high-quality sequences were obtained, which resulted in 26 
Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were assigned to Ascomycota, 
Basidiomycota, and Blastocladiomycota. At subphylum level, 77.3% of 
sponge-derived sequences were affiliated with Pezizomycotina. The fungal 
compositions of T. swinhoei and X. testudinaria were different from that of 
ambient seawater. The predominant OTU shared between two sponges was rare in 
seawater, whereas the most abundant OTUs in seawater were not found in sponges. 
Additionally, the major OTUs of sponge cDNA datasets were shared in two sponges. 
The fungal diversity illustrated by sponge cDNA datasets correlated well with 
that derived from sponge DNA datasets, indicating that the major members of 
sponge-associated fungi had protein synthesis potential. This study highlighted 
the diversity of Pezizomycotina in marine sponge-fungi symbioses and the 
necessity of investigating ecological roles of sponge-associated fungi.

Gut microbiota consists of 10(10) bacteria per gram of stool. Many antibiotic 
regimens induce a reduction in both the diversity and the abundance of the gut 
flora. We analyzed one stool sample collected from a patient treated for 
drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and who ultimately died from pneumonia 
due to a Streptococcus pneumoniae 10 months later. We performed microscopic 
observation, used 70 culture conditions (microbial culturomics) with 
identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing, 
pyrosequencing, and 18S rRNA amplification and clone sequencing. Electron and 
optical microscopic observations revealed the presence of yeast, but no 
bacterial species were observed. By culture, only 39 bacterial species were 
identified, including one new species, as well as three species that have not 
been previously observed in the human gut. The pyrosequencing showed only 18 
phylotypes, detecting a lower number of bacterial species than the culture 
techniques. Only two phylotypes overlapped with culturomics. In contrast, an 
amount of chloroplasts was found. Additionally, specific molecular eukaryote 
detection found three fungal species. We recovered, for the first time, more 
cultivable than non-cultivable bacterial species in a patient with a low 
bacterial load in the gut, demonstrating the depth bias of pyrosequencing. We 
propose that the desertification of gut microbiota in this patient is a 
reflection of the total body microbiota and may have contributed to the invasive 
infection of S. pneumoniae. This finding suggests that caution should be applied 
when treating patients with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and preventive measures 
should be taken in order to avoid invasive infection.

Increasingly, host-associated microbiota are recognized to mediate pathogen 
establishment, providing new ecological perspectives on health and disease. 
Amphibian skin-associated microbiota interact with the fungal pathogen, 
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), but little is known about microbial 
turnover during host development and associations with host immune function. We 
surveyed skin microbiota of Colorado's endangered boreal toads (Anaxyrus 
boreas), sampling 181 toads across four life stages (tadpoles, metamorphs, 
subadults and adults). Our goals were to (1) understand variation in microbial 
community structure among individuals and sites, (2) characterize shifts in 
communities during development and (3) examine the prevalence and abundance of 
known Bd-inhibitory bacteria. We used high-throughput 16S and 18S rRNA gene 
sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) to characterize bacteria and microeukaryotes, 
respectively. Life stage had the largest effect on the toad skin microbial 
community, and site and Bd presence also contributed. Proteobacteria dominated 
tadpole microbial communities, but were later replaced by Actinobacteria. 
Microeukaryotes on tadpoles were dominated by the classes Alveolata and 
Stramenopiles, while fungal groups replaced these groups after metamorphosis. 
Using a novel database of Bd-inhibitory bacteria, we found fewer Bd-inhibitory 
bacteria in post-metamorphic stages correlated with increased skin fungi, 
suggesting that bacteria have a strong role in early developmental stages and 
reduce skin-associated fungi.

The effects of tsunamis on microbial ecologies have been ill-defined, especially 
in Phang Nga province, Thailand. This ecosystem was catastrophically impacted by 
the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as well as the 600 year-old tsunami in Phra Thong 
island, Phang Nga province. No study has been conducted to elucidate their 
effects on microbial ecology. This study represents the first to elucidate their 
effects on microbial ecology. We utilized metagenomics with 16S and 18S 
rDNA-barcoded pyrosequencing to obtain prokaryotic and eukaryotic profiles for 
this terrestrial site, tsunami affected (S1), as well as a parallel unaffected 
terrestrial site, non-tsunami affected (S2). S1 demonstrated unique microbial 
community patterns than S2. The dendrogram constructed using the prokaryotic 
profiles supported the unique S1 microbial communities. S1 contained more 
proportions of archaea and bacteria domains, specifically species belonging to 
Bacteroidetes became more frequent, in replacing of the other typical floras 
like Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Basidiomycota. Pathogenic microbes, 
including Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Flavobacterium spp. and Photobacterium 
spp., were also found frequently in S1. Furthermore, different metabolic 
potentials highlighted this microbial community change could impact the 
functional ecology of the site. Moreover, the habitat prediction based on 
percent of species indicators for marine, brackish, freshwater and terrestrial 
niches pointed the S1 to largely comprise marine habitat indicating-species.

Earthworms are widely known to impact soil health, having a key role in nutrient 
cycling and are often referred to as soil engineers. They are vital for soil 
microbial assemblages particularly through their feeding and burrowing activity 
in soil. Earthworms feed on soil organic matter and litter, and the resulting 
casts alter the soil microbial community. However, the gut microbiome of 
earthworms remains less known. In this study, we used amplicon sequencing of the 
16S rRNA gene for bacteria and 18S rRNA gene for eukaryotes to assess the gut 
community assemblages of earthworm species within three genera Aporrectodea, 
Allolobophora and Lumbricus that represent different life forms sharing the same 
habitat. The objective was to compare the gut microbiome profiles of eukaryotic 
and prokaryotic organisms to assess significance of earthworm life forms, and to 
explore the cross kingdom networks in an attempt to identify keystone species. 
We found a high eukaryotic diversity with a dominance of the SAR supergroup 
along with fungi and metazoan in the earthworm gut. The bacterial community were 
dominated by members of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, 
Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia. The eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities 
showed similar differences in alpha diversity, being lowest in Lumbricus 
herculeus. The beta diversity showed earthworm species as a key factor in 
shaping gut microbiomes with L. herculeus harboring distinct microbiomes 
compared to species of Aporrectodea caliginosa, A. longa, A. tuberculata and 
Allolobophora chlorotica. Cross kingdom networks showed high interactions 
between several protist and bacterial OTUs. In conclusion, this study suggested 
that the community assemblages of gut microbiomes were shaped by earthworm 
species and life form, and such assemblage consists of cross kingdom 
interactions among eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

We assessed soil fungal diversity and community structure at two sampling times 
(t1 = 47 days and t2 = 104 days of plant age) in pots associated with four maize 
cultivars, including two genetically modified (GM) cultivars by high-throughput 
pyrosequencing of the 18S rRNA gene using DNA and RNA templates. We detected no 
significant differences in soil fungal diversity and community structure 
associated with different plant cultivars. However, DNA-based analyses yielded 
lower fungal OTU richness as compared to RNA-based analyses. Clear differences 
in fungal community structure were also observed in relation to sampling time 
and the nucleic acid pool targeted (DNA versus RNA). The most abundant soil 
fungi, as recovered by DNA-based methods, did not necessary represent the most 
"active" fungi (as recovered via RNA). Interestingly, RNA-derived community 
compositions at t1 were highly similar to DNA-derived communities at t2, based 
on presence/absence measures of OTUs. We recovered large proportions of fungal 
sequences belonging to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Basidiomycota, 
especially at the RNA level, suggesting that these important and potentially 
beneficial fungi are not affected by the plant cultivars nor by GM traits (Bt 
toxin production). Our results suggest that even though DNA- and RNA-derived 
soil fungal communities can be very different at a given time, RNA composition 
may have a predictive power of fungal community development through time.

MOTIVATION: Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have produced 
large amounts of reads at low cost in a short time. In metagenomics, 16S and 18S 
rRNA gene have been widely used as marker genes to profile diversity of 
microorganisms in environmental samples. Through clustering of sequencing reads 
we can determine both number of OTUs and their relative abundance. In many 
applications, clustering of very large sequencing data with high efficiency and 
accuracy is essential for downstream analysis.
RESULTS: Here, we report a scalable D irichlet Process Means (DP-means) a 
lgorithm for c lustering e xtremely large sequencing data, termed . With an 
efficient random projection partition strategy for parallel clustering, DACE can 
cluster billions of sequences within a couple of hours. Experimental results 
show that DACE runs between 6 and 80 times faster than state-of-the-art 
programs, while maintaining overall better clustering accuracy. Using 80 cores, 
DACE clustered the Lake Taihu 16S rRNA gene sequencing data (∼316M reads, 30 GB) 
in 25 min, and the Ocean TARA Eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene sequencing data (∼500M 
reads, 88 GB) into ∼100 000 clusters within an hour. When applied to the IGC 
gene catalogs in human gut microbiome (∼10M genes), DACE produced 9.8M clusters 
with 52K redundant genes in 1.5 hours of running time.

Peat represents a globally significant pool of sequestered carbon. However, 
peatland carbon stocks are highly threatened by anthropogenic climate change, 
including drought, which leads to a large release of carbon dioxide. Although 
the enzymatic mechanisms underlying drought-driven carbon release are well 
documented, the effect of drought on peatland microbial communities has been 
little studied. Here, we carried out a replicated and controlled drought 
manipulation using intact peat 'mesocosm cores' taken from bog and fen habitats, 
and used a combination of community fingerprinting and sequencing of marker 
genes to identify community changes associated with drought. Community 
composition varied with habitat and depth. Moreover, community differences 
between mesocosm cores were stronger than the effect of the drought treatment, 
emphasising the importance of replication in microbial marker gene studies. 
While the effect of drought on the overall composition of prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic communities was weak, a subset of the microbial community did change 
in relative abundance, especially in the fen habitat at 5 cm depth. 
'Drought-responsive' OTUs were disproportionately drawn from the phyla 
Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Collectively, the data provide insights into 
the microbial community changes occurring alongside drought-driven carbon 
release from peatlands, and suggest a number of novel avenues for future 
research.

Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium 
falciparum. The vector microbiota is a likely factor influencing parasite 
transmission. The prokaryotic microbiota of mosquitoes is efficiently surveyed 
by sequencing of hypervariable regions of the 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. 
However, identification of the eukaryotic microbiota by targeting the 18s rRNA 
gene is challenging due to simultaneous amplification of the abundant 18s rRNA 
gene target in the mosquito host. Consequently, the eukaryotic microbial 
diversity of mosquitoes is vastly underexplored. An efficient methodology is 
needed to identify this component of the microbiota, expected to include 
relatives of Plasmodium. Here, we use defined panels of Anopheles samples from 
West Africa to test two experimental PCR clamp approaches to maximize the 
specific amplification of 18s rRNA gene hypervariable regions from eukaryotic 
microbes: anneal-inhibiting blocking primers and peptide-nucleic acid (PNA) 
oligonucleotide blockers. Of the two, PNA blockers were the only efficient 
blocking strategy, allowing a reduction of mosquito 18s rRNA gene sequences by 
more than 80% for the V4 hypervariable region. These PNA blockers will 
facilitate taxonomic profiling of the eukaryotic microbiota of the A. gambiae 
species complex, and contribute to a better understanding of microbial influence 
upon immunity and pathogen infection.

This study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial 
community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and 
finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. Five lambs were assigned to 
each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (T30), weaned lambs 
slaughtered at 45 days (T45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (T90). 
At slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids and 
microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. Quantitative PCR 
was used to quantify the genes encoding 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA of the rumen 
bacterial and protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential 
colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus 
flavefaciens) and amylolytic (Prevotella ruminicola, Streptococcus bovis) 
bacteria, and protozoa (Entodinium sp.). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. Intake of 
solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 
0.0001) and bacterial DNA (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis 
concentration (p < 0.01), whereas pH declined. In milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic 
bacteria were evident after 30 days. Thereafter, in the 45-day and 90-day 
groups, the proportions of R. flavefaciens decreased and R. albus increased. 
Amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of P. 
ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and S. bovis was the least abundant 
species. Protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a 
significant number of protozoa species from Entodinium and subfamily 
Isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. Lamb rumen were refaunated in 
some individuals at 90 days (Entodinium and subfamily Diplodiniinae spp.), 
although individual concentrations were variable.

Endophytic flora plays a vital role in the colonization and survival of host 
plants, especially in harsh environments, such as arid regions. This flora may, 
however, contain pathogenic species responsible for various troublesome host 
diseases. The present study is aimed at investigating the diversity of both 
cultivable and non-cultivable endophytic fungal floras in the internal tissues 
(roots and leaves) of Tunisian date palm trees (Phoenix dactylifera). 
Accordingly, 13 isolates from both root and leaf samples, exhibiting distinct 
colony morphology, were selected from potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and 
identified by a sequence match search wherein their 18S-28S internal transcribed 
spacer (ITS) sequences were compared to those available in public databases. 
These findings revealed that the cultivable root and leaf isolates fell into two 
groups, namely Nectriaceae and Pleosporaceae. Additionally, total DNA from palm 
roots and leaves was further extracted and ITS fragments were amplified. 
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the ITS from 200 
fungal clones (leaves: 100; roots: 100) using HaeIII restriction enzyme revealed 
13 distinct patterns that were further sequenced and led to the identification 
of Alternaria, Cladosporium, Davidiella (Cladosporium teleomorph), Pythium, 
Curvularia, and uncharacterized fungal endophytes. Both approaches confirmed 
that while the roots were predominantly colonized by Fusaria (members of the 
Nectriaceae family), the leaves were essentially colonized by Alternaria 
(members of the Pleosporaceae family). Overall, the findings of the present 
study constitute, to the authors' knowledge, the first extensive report on the 
diversity of endophytic fungal flora associated with date palm trees (P. 
dactylifera).

BACKGROUND: Traditional fermented dairy products are major components of the 
typical Mongolian diet since ancient times. However, almost all the previous 
studies on the microbial composition of traditional Mongolian fermented dairy 
products analyzed food samples from the Chinese Mongolian region and Mongolia 
but not the Russian Mongolian region. In this study, the bacterial and fungal 
community diversity of nineteen naturally fermented cow's milk (NFCM) samples 
from local Mongolian families residing in Kalmykia and Chita of Russia was 
investigated with pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: Firmicutes and Ascomycota were the predominant phyla respectively for 
bacteria and fungi. The abundance of the bacterial phylum Acidobacteria was 
considerably different between the samples from the two regions. At genus level, 
Lactobacillus and Pichia were the predominating bacterial and fungal genera, 
respectively, while six bacterial genera significantly differed between the 
Kalmykia (enrichment of Aeromonas, Bacillus, Clostridium, Streptococcus, 
Vogesella) and Chita (enrichment of Lactococcus) samples. The results of 
principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the bacterial or fungal 
composition of the Kalmykia and Chita samples revealed a different microbiota 
structure between the samples collected in these two locations. The redundancy 
analysis (RDA) identified 60 bacterial and 21 fungal OTUs as the key variables 
responsible for such microbiota structural difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that structural differences existed in the 
microbiota of NFCM between Kalmykia and Chita. The difference in geographic 
environment may be an important factor influencing the microbial diversity of 
NFCM made by the Mongolians in Russia.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) comprise one of the main components of soil 
microbiota in most agroecosystems. These obligate mutualistic symbionts colonize 
the roots of most plants, including crop plants. Many papers have indicated that 
different crop management practices could affect AMF communities and their root 
colonization. However, there is little knowledge available on the influence of 
conventional and low-input agriculture on root colonization and AMF molecular 
diversity in rice fields. Two different agroecosystems (continuous conventional 
high-input rice monocropping and organic farming with a five-year crop rotation) 
and two different water management regimes have been considered in this study. 
Both morphological and molecular analyses were performed. The soil mycorrhizal 
potential, estimated using clover trap cultures, was high and similar in the two 
agroecosystems. The diversity of the AMF community in the soil, calculated by 
means of PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism) and 18S rDNA sequencing on clover trap cultures roots, was higher 
for the organic cultivation. The rice roots cultivated in the conventional 
agrosystem or under permanent flooding showed no AMF colonization, while the 
rice plants grown under the organic agriculture system showed typical 
mycorrhization patterns. Considered together, our data suggest that a high-input 
cropping system and conventional flooding depress AMF colonization in rice roots 
and that organic managements could help maintain a higher diversity of AMF 
communities in soil.

This study demonstrates both prokaryotic and eukaryotic community structures and 
dominant taxonomies in different positions of the greatest estuary reservoir for 
drinking water source in the world in four seasons of one year using 454 
pyrosequencing method with total of 312,949 16S rRNA and 374,752 18S rRNA gene 
fragments, including 1,652 bacteria OTUs and 1,182 fungus OTUs. During winter 
and spring, the community composition at the phylum level showed that 
microorganisms had similar structures but their quantities were different. 
Similarly, obvious changes at the genus level were observed among the samples 
taken in winter and spring between summer and fall. Microorganisms located the 
reservoir inlet were founded to be different from those in rear at both phylum 
and genus level. Air temperature had a stronger effect than sampling location on 
the microbial community structure. Total nitrogen and dissolved oxygen were 
algae-monitoring indicators during the whole year. Moreover, Bacillus was an 
efficient indicator during summer and autumn for bacteria OTUs.

Antibiotic use in humans has been associated with outgrowth of fungi. Here we 
used a murine model to investigate the gut microbiome over 76 days of treatment 
with vancomycin, ampicillin, neomycin, and metronidazole and subsequent 
recovery. Mouse stool was studied as a surrogate for the microbiota of the lower 
gastrointestinal tract. The abundance of fungi and bacteria was measured using 
quantitative PCR, and the proportional composition of the communities quantified 
using 454/Roche pyrosequencing of rRNA gene tags. Prior to treatment, bacteria 
outnumbered fungi by >3 orders of magnitude. Upon antibiotic treatment, bacteria 
dropped in abundance >3 orders of magnitude, so that the predominant 16S 
sequences detected became transients derived from food. Upon cessation of 
treatment, bacterial communities mostly returned to their previous numbers and 
types after 8 weeks, though communities remained detectably different from 
untreated controls. Fungal communities varied substantially over time, even in 
the untreated controls. Separate cages within the same treatment group showed 
radical differences, but mice within a cage generally behaved similarly. Fungi 
increased ∼40-fold in abundance upon antibiotic treatment but declined back to 
their original abundance after cessation of treatment. At the last time point, 
Candida remained more abundant than prior to treatment. These data show that 1) 
gut fungal populations change radically during normal mouse husbandry, 2) fungi 
grow out in the gut upon suppression of bacterial communities with antibiotics, 
and 3) perturbations due to antibiotics persist long term in both the fungal and 
bacterial microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Fungi play critical roles in many ecosystems, cause serious diseases 
in plants and animals, and pose significant threats to human health and 
structural integrity problems in built environments. While most fungal diversity 
remains unknown, the development of PCR primers for the internal transcribed 
spacer (ITS) combined with next-generation sequencing has substantially improved 
our ability to profile fungal microbial diversity. Although the high sequence 
variability in the ITS region facilitates more accurate species identification, 
it also makes multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis unreliable 
across evolutionarily distant fungi because the sequences are hard to align 
accurately. To address this issue, we created ghost-tree, a bioinformatics tool 
that integrates sequence data from two genetic markers into a single 
phylogenetic tree that can be used for diversity analyses. Our approach starts 
with a "foundation" phylogeny based on one genetic marker whose sequences can be 
aligned across organisms spanning divergent taxonomic groups (e.g., fungal 
families). Then, "extension" phylogenies are built for more closely related 
organisms (e.g., fungal species or strains) using a second more rapidly evolving 
genetic marker. These smaller phylogenies are then grafted onto the foundation 
tree by mapping taxonomic names such that each corresponding foundation-tree tip 
would branch into its new "extension tree" child.
RESULTS: We applied ghost-tree to graft fungal extension phylogenies derived 
from ITS sequences onto a foundation phylogeny derived from fungal 18S 
sequences. Our analysis of simulated and real fungal ITS data sets found that 
phylogenetic distances between fungal communities computed using ghost-tree 
phylogenies explained significantly more variance than non-phylogenetic 
distances. The phylogenetic metrics also improved our ability to distinguish 
small differences (effect sizes) between microbial communities, though results 
were similar to non-phylogenetic methods for larger effect sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: The Silva/UNITE-based ghost tree presented here can be easily 
integrated into existing fungal analysis pipelines to enhance the resolution of 
fungal community differences and improve understanding of these communities in 
built environments. The ghost-tree software package can also be used to develop 
phylogenetic trees for other marker gene sets that afford different taxonomic 
resolution, or for bridging genome trees with amplicon trees.

Leprosy urgently needs a precise and early diagnostic tool. The sensitivity of 
the direct (bacilli staining, Mycobacterium leprae DNA) and indirect (antibody 
levels, T cell assays) diagnostics methods vary based on the clinical form. 
Recently, PCR-based M. leprae DNA detection has been shown to differentially 
diagnose leprosy from other dermatological conditions. However, accuracy can 
still be improved, especially for use with less invasive clinical samples. We 
tested different commercial DNA extraction kits: DNeasy Blood & Tissue, QIAamp 
DNA Microbiome, Maxwell 16 DNA Purification, PowerSoil DNA Isolation; as well as 
in-house phenol-chloroform and Trizol/FastPrep methods. Extraction was performed 
on M. leprae-infected mouse footpads and different clinical samples of leprosy 
patients (skin biopsies and scrapings, lesion, oral and nasal swabs, body hair, 
blood on FTA cards, peripheral whole blood). We observed that the Microbiome kit 
was able to enrich for mycobacterial DNA, most likely due the enzymatic 
digestion cocktail along with mechanical disruption involved in this method. 
Consequently, we had a significant increase in sensitivity in skin biopsies from 
paucibacillary leprosy patients using a duplex qPCR targeting 16S rRNA (M. 
leprae) and 18S rRNA (mammal) in the StepOnePlus system. Our data showed that 
the presence of M. leprae DNA was best detected in skin biopsies and skin 
scrapings, independent of the extraction method or the clinical form. For 
multibacillary patients, detection of M. leprae DNA in nasal swabs indicates the 
possibility of having a much less invasive sample that can be used for the 
purposes of DNA sequencing for relapse analysis and drug resistance monitoring. 
Overall, DNA extracted with the Microbiome kit presented the best bacilli 
detection rate for paucibacillary cases, indicating that investments in 
extraction methods with mechanical and DNA digestion should be made.

1. Animal hosts harbour diverse and often specific bacterial communities 
(microbiota) in their gut. These microbiota can provide crucial services to the 
host such as aiding in digestion of food and immune defence. However, the 
ecological factors correlating with and eventually shaping these microbiota 
under natural conditions are poorly understood. 2. Bumblebees have recently been 
shown to possess simple and highly specific microbiota. We here examine the 
dynamics of these microbiota in field colonies of the bumblebee Bombus 
terrestris over one season. The gut bacteria were assessed with 
culture-independent methods, that is, with terminal restriction fragment length 
profiles of the 16S rRNA gene. 3. To further understand the factors that affect 
the microbiota, we experimentally manipulated field-placed colonies in a fully 
factorial experiment by providing additional food or by priming the workers' 
immune system by injecting heat-killed bacteria. We furthermore looked at 
possible correlates of diversity and composition of the microbiota for (i) 
natural infections with the microbial parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema 
bombi, (ii) bumblebee worker size, (iii) colony identity, and (iv) colony age. 
4. We found an increase in diversity of the microbiota in individuals naturally 
infected with either C. bombi or N. bombi. Crithidia bombi infections, however, 
appear to be only indirectly linked with higher microbial diversity when 
comparing colonies. The treatments of priming the immune system with heat-killed 
bacteria and additional food supply, as well as host body size, had no effect on 
the diversity or composition of the microbiota. Host colony identity had only a 
weak effect on the composition of the microbiota at the level of resolution of 
our method. We found both significant increases and decreases in the relative 
abundance of selected bacterial taxa over the season. 5. We present the first 
study on the ecological dynamics of gut microbiota in bumblebees and identify 
parasite infections, colony identity and colony age as important factors 
influencing the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities. The 
absence of an effect of our otherwise effective experimental treatments suggests 
a remarkable ability of the host to maintain a homoeostasis in this community 
under widely different environments.

Microbiome assemblages of plants and animals often show a degree of correlation 
with host phylogeny; an eco-evolutionary pattern known as phylosymbiosis. Using 
16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile the microbiome, paired with COI, 18S rRNA 
and ITS1 host phylogenies, phylosymbiosis was investigated in four groups of 
coral reef invertebrates (scleractinian corals, octocorals, sponges and 
ascidians). We tested three commonly used metrics to evaluate the extent of 
phylosymbiosis: (a) intraspecific versus interspecific microbiome variation, (b) 
topological comparisons between host phylogeny and hierarchical clustering 
(dendrogram) of host-associated microbial communities, and (c) correlation of 
host phylogenetic distance with microbial community dissimilarity. In all 
instances, intraspecific variation in microbiome composition was significantly 
lower than interspecific variation. Similarly, topological congruency between 
host phylogeny and the associated microbial dendrogram was more significant than 
would be expected by chance across all groups, except when using unweighted 
UniFrac distance (compared with weighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). 
Interestingly, all but the ascidians showed a significant positive correlation 
between host phylogenetic distance and associated microbial dissimilarity. Our 
findings provide new perspectives on the diverse nature of marine phylosymbioses 
and the complex roles of the microbiome in the evolution of marine 
invertebrates.

AIMS: To characterize the predominant micro-organisms in a Ghanaian traditional 
fermented dairy product, nyarmie, made from cows' milk, using both culture- and 
nonculture-based methods.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of nyarmie were analysed from three production 
sites in Accra, by determining the counts on selective culture media. The 
microbial diversity occurring in nyarmie was also evaluated by 16S/18S ribosomal 
DNA PCR amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Results 
showed that nyarmie contained lactococci and lactobacilli in the range of 10(8) 
and 10(10) CFU ml(-1), respectively, and yeasts at around 10(7) CFU ml(-1). The 
pH ranged between 3.49 and 4.25. The predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in 
nyarmie were Leuconostocmesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides, Streptococcus 
thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lact.helveticus, Lact. 
delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
was the predominant yeast species. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. delbrueckii 
was not detected by cultivation but its predominance was revealed by PCR-DGGE 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The flora in products from different producers varied in the LAB 
composition present and may result in variations in product quality.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Development and use of starter cultures 
for nyarmie may be beneficial in improving the consistency of product quality.

Molecular ecological surveys of the human gut microbiota to date have focused on 
the prokaryotic fraction of the community and have revealed a remarkable degree 
of bacterial diversity and functionality. However, there is a dearth of 
information on the eukaryotic composition of the microbiota, and no 
culture-independent sequence-based surveys of human faeces are available. 
Culture-independent analyses based on DNA extraction and polymerase chain 
reaction targeting both the total eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes and fungal internal 
transcribed regions (ITS), together with culture-dependent analyses of fungi, 
were performed on a group of healthy volunteers. Temporal analysis was also 
included wherever possible. Collectively, the data presented in this study 
indicate that eukaryotic diversity of the human gut is low, largely temporally 
stable and predominated by different subtypes of Blastocystis. Specific analyses 
of the fungal populations indicate that a disparity exists between the 
cultivable fraction, which is dominated by Candida sp, and culture-independent 
analysis, where sequences identical to members of the genera 
Gloeotinia/Paecilomyces and Galactomyces were most frequently retrieved from 
both fungal ITS profiles and subsequent clone libraries. Collectively, these 
results highlight the presence of unprecedented intestinal eukaryotic 
inhabitants whose functional roles are as yet unknown in healthy individuals. 
Furthermore, differences between results obtained from traditionally employed 
culture-based methods and those obtained from culture-independent techniques 
highlight similar anomalies to that encountered when first analysing the 
bacterial diversity of the human faecal microbiota using culture-independent 
surveys.

In the present study, soil bacterial and fungal communities across vanilla 
continuous cropping time-series fields were assessed through deep pyrosequencing 
of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. 
The results demonstrated that the long-term monoculture of vanilla significantly 
altered soil microbial communities. Soil fungal diversity index increased with 
consecutive cropping years, whereas soil bacterial diversity was relatively 
stable. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity cluster and UniFrac-weighted principal 
coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed that monoculture time was the major 
determinant for fungal community structure, but not for bacterial community 
structure. The relative abundances (RAs) of the Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, 
Bacteroidetes, and Basidiomycota phyla were depleted along the years of vanilla 
monoculture. Pearson correlations at the phyla level demonstrated that 
Actinobacteria, Armatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Firmicutes 
had significant negative correlations with vanilla disease index (DI), while no 
significant correlation for fungal phyla was observed. In addition, the amount 
of the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum accumulated with increasing years and was 
significantly positively correlated with vanilla DI. By contrast, the abundance 
of beneficial bacteria, including Bradyrhizobium and Bacillus, significantly 
decreased over time. In sum, soil weakness and vanilla stem wilt disease after 
long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to the alteration of the soil 
microbial community membership and structure, i.e., the reduction of the 
beneficial microbes and the accumulation of the fungal pathogen.

Diverse sessile organisms inhabit the coral reef ecosystems, including corals, 
sponges, and sea anemones. In the past decades, scleractinian corals (Cnidaria, 
Anthozoa, Scleractinia) and their associated microorganisms have attracted much 
attention. Zoanthids (Cnidaria, Anthozoa, Zoanthidea) are commonly found in 
coral reefs. However, little is known about the community structure of 
zoanthid-associated microbiota. In this study, the microbial community 
associated with the zoanthid Palythoa australiae in the South China Sea was 
investigated by 454 pyrosequencing. As a result, 2,353 bacterial, 583 archaeal, 
and 36 eukaryotic microbial ribotypes were detected, respectively. A total of 22 
bacterial phyla (16 formally described phyla and six candidate phyla) were 
recovered. Proteobacteria was the most abundant group, followed by Chloroflexi 
and Actinobacteria. High-abundance Rhizobiales and diverse Chloroflexi were 
observed in the bacterial community. The archaeal population was composed of 
Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, with Marine Group I as the dominant lineage. In 
particular, Candidatus Nitrosopumilus dominated the archaeal community. Besides 
bacteria and archaea, the zoanthid harbored eukaryotic microorganisms including 
fungi and algae though their diversity was very low. This study provided the 
first insights into the microbial community associated with P. australiae by 454 
pyrosequencing, consequently laid a basis for the understanding of the 
association of P. australiae-microbes symbioses.

BACKGROUND: The association between sinonasal microbiome and clinical outcomes 
of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is unclear. We performed a 
systematic review of prior studies evaluating the CRS microbiome in relation to 
clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Computerized searches of PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and EMBASE were 
updated through October 2019 revealing a total of 9 studies including 244 CRS 
patients. A systematic review of the literature was performed, including data 
extraction focusing on sample region, sequencing platforms, predominant 
organisms, and outcomes measures.
RESULTS: Nine criterion-meeting studies included 244 CRS patients, with varied 
results. Eight studies used 16s-ribosomal RNA (16s-rRNA) gene sequencing to 
assess the sinonasal microbiome and 1 used 16s-rRNA PhyloChip analysis. Seven 
studies used Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores, 1 applied another CRS symptom 
metric, and 1 used need for additional procedures/antibiotics as the primary 
clinical outcome. Three studies suggest that baseline abundance of phylum 
Actinobacteria (specifically genus Corynebacterium) was predictive of better 
surgical outcome. One study found C. tuberculostearicum was positively 
correlated with symptom severity. Another study revealed genus Escherichia was 
overrepresented in CRS and had positive correlation with increased symptom 
scores. In addition, 1 study identified Acinetobacter johnsonii to be associated 
with improvement in symptom scores while supporting Pseudomonas aeruginosa as 
having a negative impact on quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Microbiome data are varied in their association with clinical 
outcomes of CRS patients. Further research is required to identify if 
predominance of certain microbes within the microbiome is predictive of CRS 
patients' outcomes.

Despite the considerable number of studies reported to date, the causative 
agents of pneumonia are not completely identified. We comprehensively applied 
modern and traditional laboratory diagnostic techniques to identify microbiota 
in patients who were admitted to or developed pneumonia in intensive care units 
(ICUs). During a three-year period, we tested the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 
of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, 
non-ventilator ICU pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia, and compared the results 
with those from patients without pneumonia (controls). Samples were tested by 
amplification of 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA genes followed by cloning and sequencing and 
by PCR to target specific pathogens. We also included culture, amoeba 
co-culture, detection of antibodies to selected agents and urinary antigen 
tests. Based on molecular testing, we identified a wide repertoire of 160 
bacterial species of which 73 have not been previously reported in pneumonia. 
Moreover, we found 37 putative new bacterial phylotypes with a 16S rDNA gene 
divergence ≥ 98% from known phylotypes. We also identified 24 fungal species of 
which 6 have not been previously reported in pneumonia and 7 viruses. Patients 
can present up to 16 different microorganisms in a single BAL (mean ± SD; 3.77 ± 
2.93). Some pathogens considered to be typical for ICU pneumonia such as 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus species can be detected as commonly in 
controls as in pneumonia patients which strikingly highlights the existence of a 
core pulmonary microbiota. Differences in the microbiota of different forms of 
pneumonia were documented.

The molecular diversity of the rumen microbiome was investigated in five 
semi-domesticated adult female Norwegian reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) 
grazing on natural summer pastures on the coast of northern Norway (71.00 
degrees N, 25.30 degrees E). Mean population densities (numbers per gram wet 
weight) of methanogenic archaea, rumen bacteria and ciliate protozoa, estimated 
using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were 3.17x10(9), 
5.17x10(11) and 4.02x10(7), respectively. Molecular diversity of rumen 
methanogens was revealed using a 16S rRNA gene library (54 clones) constructed 
using pooled PCR products from the whole rumen contents of the five individual 
reindeer. Based upon a similarity criterion of <97%, a total of 19 distinct 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, nine of which are potential 
new species. The 16S rRNA sequences generated from the reindeer rumen exhibited 
a high degree of sequence similarity to methanogens affiliated with the families 
Methanobacteriaceae (14 OTUs) and Methanosarcinaceae (one OTU). Four of the OTUs 
detected belonged to a group of uncultivated archaea previously found in 
domestic ruminants and thought to be dominant in the rumen together with 
Methanobrevibacter spp. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of the 
rumen bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the protozoal 18S rRNA gene indicated a high 
degree of animal variation, although some bands were common to all individuals. 
Automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) profiling of the ruminal 
Neocallimastigales population indicated that the reindeer are likely to contain 
more than one type of anaerobic fungus. The ARISA profile from one animal was 
distinct from the other four. This is the first molecular investigation of the 
ruminal methanogenic archaea in reindeer, revealing higher numbers than expected 
based on methane emission data available. Also, many of the reindeer archaeal 
16S rRNA gene sequences were similar to those reported in domesticated ruminants 
in Australia, Canada, China, New Zealand and Venezuela, supporting previous 
findings that there seems to be no host type or geographical effect on the 
methanogenic archaea community structure in ruminants.

High-throughput sequencing of ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicons has opened up 
the door to large-scale comparative studies of microbial community structures. 
The short reads currently produced by massively parallel sequencing technologies 
make the choice of sequencing region crucial for accurate phylogenetic 
assignments. While for 16S rDNA, relevant regions have been well described, no 
truly systematic design of 18S rDNA primers aimed at resolving eukaryotic 
diversity has yet been reported. Here we used 31,862 18S rDNA sequences to 
design a set of broad-taxonomic range degenerate PCR primers. We simulated the 
phylogenetic information that each candidate primer pair would retrieve using 
paired- or single-end reads of various lengths, representing different 
sequencing technologies. Primer pairs targeting the V4 region performed best, 
allowing discrimination with paired-end reads as short as 150 bp (with 75% 
accuracy at genus level). The conditions for PCR amplification were optimised 
for one of these primer pairs and this was used to amplify 18S rDNA sequences 
from isolates as well as from a range of environmental samples which were then 
Illumina sequenced and analysed, revealing good concordance between expected and 
observed results. In summary, the reported primer sets will allow minimally 
biased assessment of eukaryotic diversity in different microbial ecosystems.

PCR amplification followed by deep sequencing of homologous gene regions is 
increasingly used to characterize the diversity and taxonomic composition of 
marine eukaryotic communities. This approach may generate millions of sequences 
for hundreds of samples simultaneously. Therefore, tools that researchers can 
use to visualize complex patterns of diversity for these massive datasets are 
essential. Efforts by microbiologists to understand the Earth and human 
microbiomes using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene has led to the 
development of several user-friendly, open-source software packages that can be 
similarly used to analyze eukaryotic datasets. Quantitative Insights Into 
Microbial Ecology (QIIME) offers some of the most helpful data visualization 
tools. Here, we describe functionalities to import OTU tables generated with any 
molecular marker (e.g., 18S, COI, ITS) and associated metadata into QIIME. We 
then present a range of analytical tools implemented within QIIME that can be 
used to obtain insights about patterns of alpha and beta diversity for marine 
eukaryotes.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to reduce plant stress and 
improve their health and growth, making them important components of the 
plant-root associated microbiome, especially in stressful conditions such as 
petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) contaminated environments. Purposely manipulating 
the root-associated AMF assemblages in order to improve plant health and 
modulate their interaction with the rhizosphere microbes could lead to increased 
agricultural crop yields and phytoremediation performance by the host plant and 
its root-associated microbiota. In this study, we tested whether repeated 
inoculations with a Proteobacteria consortium influenced plant productivity and 
the AMF assemblages associated with the root and rhizosphere of four plant 
species growing either in non-contaminated natural soil or in sediments 
contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. A mesocosm experiment was performed in 
a randomized complete block design in four blocks with two factors: (1) 
substrate contamination (contaminated or not contaminated), and (2) inoculation 
(or not) with a bacterial consortium composed of ten isolates of Proteobacteria. 
Plants were grown in a greenhouse over four months, after which the effect of 
treatments on plant biomass and petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in the 
substrate were determined. MiSeq amplicon sequencing, targeting the 18S rRNA 
gene, was used to assess AMF community structures in the roots and rhizosphere 
of plants growing in both contaminated and non-contaminated substrates. We also 
investigated the contribution of plant identity and biotope (plant roots and 
rhizospheric soil) in shaping the associated AMF assemblages. Our results showed 
that while inoculation caused a significant shift in AMF communities, the 
substrate contamination had a much stronger influence on their structure, 
followed by the biotope and plant identity to a lesser extent. Moreover, 
inoculation significantly increased plant biomass production and was associated 
with a decreased petroleum hydrocarbons dissipation in the contaminated soil. 
The outcome of this study provides knowledge on the factors influencing the 
diversity and community structure of AMF associated with indigenous plants 
following repeated inoculation of a bacterial consortium. It highlights the 
dominance of soil chemical properties, such as petroleum hydrocarbon presence, 
over biotic factors and inputs, such as plant species and microbial 
inoculations, in determining the plant-associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
communities.

The effects of abrupt dietary transition on the faecal microbiota of forage-fed 
horses over a 3-week period were investigated. Yearling Thoroughbred fillies 
reared as a cohort were exclusively fed on either an ensiled conserved 
forage-grain diet ("Group A"; n = 6) or pasture ("Group B"; n = 6) for three 
weeks prior to the study. After the Day 0 faecal samples were collected, horses 
of Group A were abruptly transitioned to pasture. Both groups continued to graze 
similar pasture for three weeks, with faecal samples collected at 4-day 
intervals. DNA was isolated from the faeces and microbial 16S and 18S rRNA gene 
amplicons were generated and analysed by pyrosequencing. The faecal bacterial 
communities of both groups of horses were highly diverse (Simpson's index of 
diversity > 0.8), with differences between the two groups on Day 0 (P < 0.017 
adjusted for multiple comparisons). There were differences between Groups A and 
B in the relative abundances of four genera, BF311 (family Bacteroidaceae; P = 
0.003), CF231 (family Paraprevotellaceae; P = 0.004), and currently unclassified 
members within the order Clostridiales (P = 0.003) and within the family 
Lachnospiraceae (P = 0.006). The bacterial community of Group A horses became 
similar to Group B within four days of feeding on pasture, whereas the structure 
of the archaeal community remained constant pre- and post-dietary change. The 
community structure of the faecal microbiota (bacteria, archaea and ciliate 
protozoa) of pasture-fed horses was also identified. The initial differences 
observed appeared to be linked to recent dietary history, with the bacterial 
community of the forage-fed horses responding rapidly to abrupt dietary change.

Although gorillas regarded as the largest extant species of primates and have a 
close phylogenetic relationship with humans, eukaryotic communities have not 
been previously studied in these populations. Herein, 35 eukaryotic primer sets 
targeting the 18S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer gene and other specific 
genes were used firstly to explore the eukaryotes in a fecal sample from a wild 
western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Then specific real-time PCRs 
were achieved in additional 48 fecal samples from 21 individual gorillas to 
investigate the presence of human eukaryotic pathogens. In total, 1,572 clones 
were obtained and sequenced from the 15 cloning libraries, resulting in the 
retrieval of 87 eukaryotic species, including 52 fungi, 10 protozoa, 4 nematodes 
and 21 plant species, of which 52, 5, 2 and 21 species, respectively, have never 
before been described in gorillas. We also reported the occurrence of pathogenic 
fungi and parasites (i.e. Oesophagostomum bifurcum (86%), Necator americanus 
(43%), Candida tropicalis (81%) and other pathogenic fungi were identified). In 
conclusion, molecular techniques using multiple primer sets may offer an 
effective tool to study complex eukaryotic communities and to identify potential 
pathogens in the gastrointestinal tracts of primates.

Eukaryotic microorganisms are important but understudied components of the human 
microbiome. Here we present a pipeline for analysis of deep sequencing data on 
single cell eukaryotes. We designed a new 18S rRNA gene-specific PCR primer set 
and compared a published rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene primer 
set. Amplicons were tested against 24 specimens from defined eukaryotes and 
eight well-characterized human stool samples. A software pipeline 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/brocc/ was developed for taxonomic attribution, 
validated against simulated data, and tested on pyrosequence data. This study 
provides a well-characterized tool kit for sequence-based enumeration of 
eukaryotic organisms in human microbiome samples.

Oil sands are surface exposed in river valley outcrops in northeastern Alberta, 
where flat slabs (tablets) of weathered, bitumen-saturated sandstone can be 
retrieved from outcrop cliffs or from riverbeds. Although the average yearly 
surface temperature of this region is low (0.7°C), we found that the 
temperatures of the exposed surfaces of outcrop cliffs reached 55 to 60°C on 
sunny summer days, with daily maxima being 27 to 31°C. Analysis of the 
cooccurrence of taxa derived from pyrosequencing of 16S/18S rRNA genes indicated 
that an aerobic microbial network of fungi and hydrocarbon-, methane-, or 
acetate-oxidizing heterotrophic bacteria was present in all cliff tablets. 
Metagenomic analyses indicated an elevated presence of fungal cytochrome P450 
monooxygenases in these samples. This network was distinct from the 
heterotrophic community found in riverbeds, which included fewer fungi. A subset 
of cliff tablets had a network of anaerobic and/or thermophilic taxa, including 
methanogens, Firmicutes, and Thermotogae, in the center. Long-term aerobic 
incubation of outcrop samples at 55°C gave a thermophilic microbial community. 
Analysis of residual bitumen with a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance 
mass spectrometer indicated that aerobic degradation proceeded at 55°C but not 
at 4°C. Little anaerobic degradation was observed. These results indicate that 
bitumen degradation on outcrop surfaces is a largely aerobic process with a 
minor anaerobic contribution and is catalyzed by a consortium of bacteria and 
fungi. Bitumen degradation is stimulated by periodic high temperatures on 
outcrop cliffs, which cause significant decreases in bitumen viscosity.

There is growing concern that predicted changes to global ocean chemistry will 
interact with anthropogenic pollution to significantly alter marine microbial 
composition and function. However, knowledge of the compounding effects of 
climate change stressors and anthropogenic pollution is limited. Here, we used 
16S and 18S rRNA (cDNA)-based activity profiling to investigate the differential 
responses of selected microbial taxa to ocean acidification and oil hydrocarbon 
contamination under controlled laboratory conditions. Our results revealed that 
a lower relative abundance of sulphate-reducing bacteria 
(Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus clade) due to an adverse effect of seawater 
acidification and oil hydrocarbon contamination (reduced pH-oil treatment) may 
be coupled to changes in sediment archaeal communities. In particular, we 
observed a pronounced compositional shift and marked reduction in the prevalence 
of otherwise abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the 
archaeal Marine Benthic Group B and Marine Hydrothermal Vent Group (MHVG) in the 
reduced pH-oil treatment. Conversely, the abundance of several putative 
hydrocarbonoclastic fungal OTUs was higher in the reduced pH-oil treatment. 
Sediment hydrocarbon profiling, furthermore, revealed higher concentrations of 
several alkanes in the reduced pH-oil treatment, corroborating the functional 
implications of the structural changes to microbial community composition. 
Collectively, our results advance the understanding of the response of a complex 
microbial community to the interaction between reduced pH and anthropogenic 
pollution. In future acidified marine environments, oil hydrocarbon 
contamination may alter the typical mixotrophic and k-/r-strategist composition 
of surface sediment microbiomes towards a more heterotrophic state with lower 
doubling rates, thereby impairing the ability of the ecosystem to recover from 
acute oil contamination events.

Diversity of picoeukaryotes at an oligotrophic site off the Northeastern Red Sea 
Coast.

BACKGROUND: Picoeukaryotes are protists ≤ 3 μm composed of a wide diversity of 
taxonomic groups. They are an important constituent of the ocean's microbiota 
and perform essential ecological roles in marine nutrient and carbon cycles. 
Despite their importance, the true extent of their diversity has only recently 
been uncovered by molecular surveys that resulted in the discovery of a 
substantial number of previously unknown groups. No study on picoeukaryote 
diversity has been conducted so far in the main Red Sea basin-a unique marine 
environment characterized by oligotrophic conditions, high levels of irradiance, 
high salinity and increased water temperature.
RESULTS: We sampled surface waters off the coast of the northeastern Red Sea and 
analyzed the picoeukaryotic diversity using Sanger-based clone libraries of the 
18S rRNA gene in order to produce high quality, nearly full-length sequences. 
The community captured by our approach was dominated by three main phyla, the 
alveolates, stramenopiles and chlorophytes; members of Radiolaria, Cercozoa and 
Haptophyta were also found, albeit in low abundances. Photosynthetic organisms 
were especially diverse and abundant in the sample, confirming the importance of 
picophytoplankton for primary production in the basin as well as indicating the 
existence of numerous ecological micro-niches for this trophic level in the 
upper euphotic zone. Heterotrophic organisms were mostly composed of the 
presumably parasitic Marine Alveolates (MALV) and the presumably bacterivorous 
Marine Stramenopiles (MAST) groups. A small number of sequences that did not 
cluster closely with known clades were also found, especially in the MALV-II 
group, some of which could potentially belong to novel clades.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first snapshot of the picoeukaryotic 
diversity present in surface waters of the Red Sea, hence setting the stage for 
large-scale surveying and characterization of the eukaryotic diversity in the 
entire basin. Our results indicate that the picoeukaryotic community in the 
northern Red Sea, despite its unique physiochemical conditions (i.e. increased 
temperatures, increased salinity, and high UV irradiance) does not differ vastly 
from its counterparts in other oligotrophic marine habitats.

BACKGROUND: The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical cycles and 
changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet, the 
underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we 
investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (selection, dispersal and 
ecological drift) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical 
surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). 
Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this 
assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of 
ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of 
surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data 
(16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions 
Malaspina-2010 and TARA-Oceans.
RESULTS: We found that the two main components of the tropical and subtropical 
surface-ocean microbiota, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes, appear to be 
structured by different ecological mechanisms. Picoeukaryotic communities were 
predominantly structured by dispersal-limitation, while prokaryotic counterparts 
appeared to be shaped by the combined action of dispersal-limitation, selection 
and drift. Temperature-driven selection appeared as a major factor, out of a few 
selected factors, influencing species co-occurrence networks in prokaryotes but 
not in picoeukaryotes, indicating that association patterns may contribute to 
understand ocean microbiota structure and response to selection. Other measured 
abiotic variables seemed to have limited selective effects on community 
structure in the tropical and subtropical ocean. Picoeukaryotes displayed a 
higher spatial differentiation between communities and a higher distance decay 
when compared to prokaryotes, consistent with a scenario of higher dispersal 
limitation in the former after considering environmental heterogeneity. Lastly, 
random dynamics or drift seemed to have a more important role in structuring 
prokaryotic communities than picoeukaryotic counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: The differential action of ecological mechanisms seems to cause 
contrasting biogeography, in the tropical and subtropical ocean, among the 
smallest surface plankton, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes. This suggests that 
the idiosyncrasy of the main constituents of the ocean microbiota should be 
considered in order to understand its current and future configuration, which is 
especially relevant in a context of global change, where the reaction of surface 
ocean plankton to temperature increase is still unclear. Video Abstract.

Signals from the intestinal microbiota are important for normal host physiology; 
alteration of the microbiota (dysbiosis) is associated with multiple disease 
states. We determined the effect of antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis on 
circulating cytokine levels and severity of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the 
heart. Treatment of Dahl S rats with a minimally absorbed antibiotic vancomycin, 
in the drinking water, decreased circulating leptin levels by 38%, resulted in 
smaller myocardial infarcts (27% reduction), and improved recovery of 
postischemic mechanical function (35%) as compared with untreated controls. 
Vancomycin altered the abundance of intestinal bacteria and fungi, measured by 
16S and 18S ribosomal DNA quantity. Pretreatment with leptin (0.12 μg/kg i.v.) 
24 h before ischemia/reperfusion abolished cardioprotection produced by 
vancomycin treatment. Dahl S rats fed the commercially available probiotic 
product Goodbelly, which contains the leptin-suppressing bacteria Lactobacillus 
plantarum 299v, also resulted in decreased circulating leptin levels by 41%, 
smaller myocardial infarcts (29% reduction), and greater recovery of 
postischemic mechanical function (23%). Pretreatment with leptin (0.12 μg/kg 
i.v.) abolished cardioprotection produced by Goodbelly. This proof-of-concept 
study is the first to identify a mechanistic link between changes in intestinal 
microbiota and myocardial infarction and demonstrates that a probiotic 
supplement can reduce myocardial infarct size.

Identification of microbes that actively utilize root exudates is essential to 
understand plant-microbe interactions. To identify active root exudate-utilizing 
microorganisms associated with switchgrass - a potential bioenergy crop - plants 
were labelled in situ with (13) CO2 , and 16S and 18S rRNA genes in the (13) 
C-labelled rhizosphere DNA were pyrosequenced. Multi-pulse labelling for 5 days 
produced detectable (13) C-DNA, which was well separated from unlabelled DNA. 
Methylibium from the order Burkholderiales were the most heavily labelled 
bacteria. Pythium, Auricularia and Galerina were the most heavily labelled 
eukaryotic microbes. We also identified a Glomus intraradices-like species; 
Glomus members are arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that are able to colonize the 
switchgrass root. All of these heavily labelled microorganisms were also among 
the most abundant species in the rhizosphere. Species belonging to Methylibium 
and Pythium were the most heavily labelled and the most abundant bacteria and 
eukaryotes in the rhizosphere of switchgrass. Our results revealed that nearly 
all of the dominant rhizosphere bacterial and eukaryotic microbes were able to 
utilize root exudates. The enrichment of microbial species in the rhizosphere is 
selective and mostly due to root exudation, which functions as a nutrition 
source, promoting the growth of these microbes.

Soils provide a heterogeneous environment varying in space and time; 
consequently, the biodiversity of soil microorganisms also differs spatially and 
temporally. For soil microbes tightly associated with plant roots, such as 
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), the diversity of plant partners and seasonal 
variability in trophic exchanges between the symbionts introduce additional 
heterogeneity. To clarify the impact of such heterogeneity, we investigated 
spatiotemporal variation in AMF diversity on a plot scale (10 × 10 m) in a 
grassland managed at low intensity in southwest Germany. AMF diversity was 
determined using 18S rDNA pyrosequencing analysis of 360 soil samples taken at 
six time points within a year. We observed high AMF alpha- and beta-diversity 
across the plot and at all investigated time points. Relationships were detected 
between spatiotemporal variation in AMF OTU richness and plant species richness, 
root biomass, minimal changes in soil texture and pH. The plot was characterized 
by high AMF turnover rates with a positive spatiotemporal relationship for AMF 
beta-diversity. However, environmental variables explained only ≈20% of the 
variation in AMF communities. This indicates that the observed spatiotemporal 
richness and community variability of AMF was largely independent of the abiotic 
environment, but related to plant properties and the cooccurring microbiome.

Soil biodiversity is threatened by intensification of land use. The consequences 
of different land use on belowground biodiversity remain insufficiently explored 
for soil protists. Alongside being abundant and extremely diverse in soil, 
protists provide many ecosystem services: key players in the microbial loop, 
turnover of organic matter and stimulation of plant growth-promoting 
rhizobacteria. However, we lack knowledge of effects of site, land use intensity 
and management on diversity of soil protists. Here we assessed protist 
communities in four European arable sites with contrasting land use intensities 
at each site: Lusignan, France; Moskanjci, Slovenia; Castro Verde, Portugal and 
Scheyern, Germany as well as two grassland sites: Hainich, Germany and 
Lancaster, UK. Each site has consistent agricultural management history of low 
and high land use intensities quantified in terms of land use index (LUI). We 
employed high-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA, targeting the V4 
region of the 18S rRNA gene. By assigning the protist composition to trophic 
groups, we inspected for effects of management, and other biotic and abiotic 
variables. While overall protist richness was unaffected by LUI within sites, 
specific trophic groups such as plant pathogens and saprotrophs were affected. 
Effects on protist biome across land uses and sites were also observed. LUI 
sensitive taxa were taxonomically diverse in each plot, and their trophic groups 
responded in specific patterns to specific practices. The most abundant trophic 
group was phagotrophs (73%), followed by photoautotrophs (16%), plant pathogens 
(4%), animal parasites (2%) and saprotrophs (1%). Community compositions and 
factors affecting the structure of individual trophic groups differed between 
land uses and management systems. The agricultural management selected for 
distinct protist populations as well as specific functional traits, and the 
protist community and diversity were indeed affected by site, LUI and 
management, which indicates the ecological significance of protists in the soil 
food web.

Wastewater microbiota represents important actors of organic depollution. 
Nowadays, some species used as bioindicators of the effluent quality are still 
identified by microscopy. In the present study, we investigated eukaryotic 
diversity at the different steps of the treatment process of a wastewater 
treatment plant (aerobic, anaerobic, clarifier basins and anaerobic digester) 
using the 18S rRNA gene sequencing approach. Of the 1519 analysed sequences, we 
identified 160 operational taxonomic units. Interestingly, 56.9% of the 
phylotypes were assigned to novel phylogenetic molecular species since they show 
<97% sequence identity with their nearest affiliated representative within 
public databases. Peritrichia ciliates were the most predominant group, with 
Epistylis as the most common genus. Although anaerobic, the digester appears to 
harbor many unclassified phylotypes of protozoa species. Novel lineages such as 
LKM11 and LKM118 were widely represented in the digester. Diversity values given 
by Shannon indexes show that the clarifier is the most diversified. This work 
will help designing molecular tools that are fast, reliable, and reproducible 
for monitoring wastewater depollution and studying phylogenetic relationships 
among the wonderful world of protists within this anthropogenic ecosystem.

This study aims to compare the diversity of intestinal fungal microbiota in 
patients with different degrees of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. 
Culture-independent and culture-dependent methods were performed on 38 patients 
with hepatitis B cirrhosis, 35 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 33 HBV 
carriers, and 55 healthy volunteers. An overall fungal biodiversity of 37 
different operational taxonomic units was found in the clone libraries; only 
Candida spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were obtained by the culture-dependent 
analysis. There was a higher richness of fungal species in patients with 
hepatitis B cirrhosis than in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and the latter 
was higher than that in HBV carriers and healthy volunteers. There was little 
difference in enteric fungal diversity between HBV carriers and healthy 
volunteers. The results indicate that the diversity of enteric fungi was 
positively correlated with the disease progression of patients with different 
degrees of chronic HBV infection.

To understand the fine-scale effects of changes in nutrient availability on 
eukaryotic soil microorganisms communities, a multiple barcoding approach was 
used to analyse soil samples from four different treatments in a long-term 
fertilization experiment. We performed PCR amplification on soil DNA with primer 
pairs specifically targeting the 18S rRNA genes of all eukaryotes and three 
protist groups (Cercozoa, Chrysophyceae-Synurophyceae and Kinetoplastida) as 
well as the ITS gene of fungi and the 23S plastid rRNA gene of photoautotrophic 
microorganisms. Amplicons were pyrosequenced, and a total of 88,706 quality 
filtered reads were clustered into 1232 operational taxonomic units (OTU) across 
the six data sets. Comparisons of the taxonomic coverage achieved based on 
overlapping assignment of OTUs revealed that half of the eukaryotic taxa 
identified were missed by the universal eukaryotic barcoding marker. There were 
only little differences in OTU richness observed between organic- (farmyard 
manure), mineral- and nonfertilized soils. However, the community compositions 
appeared to be strongly structured by organic fertilization in all data sets 
other than that generated using the universal eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene primers, 
whereas mineral fertilization had only a minor effect. In addition, a 
co-occurrence based network analysis revealed complex potential interaction 
patterns between OTUs from different trophic levels, for example between 
fungivorous flagellates and fungi. Our results demonstrate that changes in pH, 
moisture and organic nutrients availability caused shifts in the composition of 
eukaryotic microbial communities at multiple trophic levels.

Ruminants rely on a complex rumen microbial community to convert dietary plant 
material to energy-yielding products. Here we developed a method to 
simultaneously analyze the community's bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, 
ciliate 18S rRNA genes and anaerobic fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 genes 
using 12 DNA samples derived from 11 different rumen samples from three host 
species (Ovis aries, Bos taurus, Cervus elephas) and multiplex 454 Titanium 
pyrosequencing. We show that the mixing ratio of the group-specific DNA 
templates before emulsion PCR is crucial to compensate for differences in 
amplicon length. This method, in contrast to using a non-specific universal 
primer pair, avoids sequencing non-targeted DNA, such as plant- or 
endophyte-derived rRNA genes, and allows increased or decreased levels of 
community structure resolution for each microbial group as needed. Communities 
analyzed with different primers always grouped by sample origin rather than by 
the primers used. However, primer choice had a greater impact on apparent 
archaeal community structure than on bacterial community structure, and biases 
for certain methanogen groups were detected. Co-occurrence analysis of microbial 
taxa from all three domains of life suggested strong within- and between-domain 
correlations between different groups of microorganisms within the rumen. The 
approach used to simultaneously characterize bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic 
components of a microbiota should be applicable to other communities occupying 
diverse habitats.

Antarctica has one of the most extreme environments on Earth, with low 
temperatures and low nutrient levels. Antarctica's organisms live primarily in 
the coastal, ice-free areas which cover approximately 0.18% of the continent's 
surface. Members of Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae are important primary 
producers in Antarctica since they can synthesize organic compounds from carbon 
dioxide and water using solar energy. However, community structures of 
photosynthetic algae in Antarctica have not yet been fully explored at molecular 
level. In this study, we collected diverse algal samples in lacustrine and 
hydro-terrestrial environments of Langhovde and Skarvsnes, which are two 
ice-free regions in East Antarctica. We performed deep amplicon sequencing of 
both 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) and 18S rRNA genes, and we explored 
the distribution of sequence variants (SVs) of these genes at single nucleotide 
difference resolution. SVs of filamentous Cyanobacteria genera, including 
Leptolyngbya, Pseudanabaena, Phormidium, Nodosilinea, Geitlerinama, and 
Tychonema, were identified in most of the samples, whereas Phormidesmis SVs were 
distributed in fewer samples. We also detected unicellular, multicellular or 
heterocyst forming Cyanobacteria strains, but in relatively small abundance. For 
SVs of eukaryotic algae, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Ochrophyta were widely 
distributed among the collected samples. In addition, there was a red colored 
bloom of eukaryotic alga, Geminigera cryophile (Cryptophyta), in the Langhovde 
coastal area. Eukaryotic SVs of Acutuncus antarcticus and/or Diphascon pingue of 
Tardigrada were dominant among most of the samples. Our data revealed the 
detailed structures of the algal communities in Langhovde and Skarvsnes. This 
will contribute to our understanding of Antarctic ecosystems and support further 
research into this subject.

The prebiotic fructooligosaccharide content of yacon makes this root an 
attractive alternative for the supplementation of a variety of food products. 
The preservation of yacon by fermentation has been proposed as an alternative to 
increase the probiotic content of the root concomitantly with its shelf life. 
Thus the fermented yacon could have significant functional content. The 
objective of this research was to characterize the biochemistry and microbiology 
of spontaneous yacon fermentation with 2% NaCl and define the viability of the 
proposed process. The biochemical analysis of spontaneous heterolactic 
fermentation of yacon showed a progressive drop in pH with increased lactic and 
acetic acids, and the production of mannitol during fermentation. The microbial 
ecology of yacon fermentation was investigated using culture-dependent and 
culture-independent methods. Bacterial cell counts revealed a dominance of 
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) over yeasts, which were also present during the first 
2 days of the fermentation. Results showed that the heterofermentative LAB were 
primarily Leuconostoc species, thus it presents a viable method to achieve long 
term preservation of this root.

To better understand the evolutionary significance of symbiotic interactions in 
nature, microbiome studies can help to identify the ecological factors that may 
shape host-associated microbial communities. In this study we explored both 16S 
and 18S rRNA microbial communities of D. armigerum from both wild caught 
individuals collected in the Amazon and individuals kept in the laboratory and 
fed on controlled diets. We also investigated the role of colony, sample type, 
development and caste on structuring microbial communities. Our bacterial 
results (16S rRNA) reveal that (1) there are colony level differences between 
bacterial communities; (2) castes do not structure communities; (3) immature 
stages (brood) have different bacterial communities than adults; and 4) 
individuals kept in the laboratory with a restricted diet showed no differences 
in their bacterial communities from their wild caught nest mates, which could 
indicate the presence of a stable and persistent resident bacterial community in 
this host species. The same categories were also tested for microbial eukaryote 
communities (18S rRNA), and (5) developmental stage has an influence on the 
diversity recovered; (6) the diversity of taxa recovered has shown this can be 
an important tool to understand additional aspects of host biology and species 
interactions.

The micro-eukaryotic diversity from the human gut was investigated using 
universal primers directed towards 18S rRNA gene, fecal samples being the source 
of DNA. The subjects in this study included two breast-fed and two 
formula-milk-fed infants and their mothers. The study revealed that the infants 
did not seem to harbour any microeukaryotes in their gut. In contrast, there 
were distinct eukaryotic microbiota present in the mothers. The investigation is 
the first of its kind in the comparative study of the human feces to reveal the 
presence of micro-eukaryotic diversity variance in infants and adults from the 
Indian subcontinent. The micro-eukaryotes encountered during the investigation 
include known gut colonizers like Blastocystis and some fungi species. Some of 
these micro-eukaryotes have been speculated to be involved in clinical 
manifestations of various diseases. The study is an attempt to highlight the 
importance of micro-eukaryotes in the human gut.

Plants are inhabited by millions of parasitic, commensal, and mutualistic 
microorganisms that coexist in complex ecological communities, and profoundly 
affect the plant's productivity, health, and capacity to cope with environmental 
stress. Therefore, a better understanding of the rhizosphere microbiome may open 
a yet untapped avenue for the rational exploitation of beneficial plant-microbe 
interactions in modern agriculture. Blueberries encompass several wild and 
cultivated species of shrubs of the genus Vaccinium that are native to North 
America. They are grown commercially for the production of fruits, which are 
considered a health food due to the rich content of minerals, trace elements, 
and phenolic compounds with antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory 
properties. Despite a long history of breeding and extensive commercial use, 
remarkably little is known about the composition and function of the blueberry 
root microbiome. To address this gap, we employed molecular approaches to 
characterize and compare microbial communities inhabiting the roots of rabbiteye 
blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum), Darrow's blueberry (Vaccinium darrowii), and 
southern highbush blueberry (SHB; an interspecific hybrid of Vaccinium 
corymbosum and V. darrowii). Our results revealed that these plant species share 
a common core rhizobiome, but at the same time differ significantly in the 
diversity, relative abundance, richness, and evenness of multiple groups of 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. Although the host signature effects 
were especially pronounced at the plant species level, we also observed 
genotype-level variations in the distribution of specific microbial taxa, which 
suggests that the assembly of the blueberry microbiome is shaped by the plant 
genotype and modifications associated with the domestication and breeding of 
members of the Vaccinium genus. We also demonstrated that the studied Vaccinium 
species differ in the abundance of beneficial rhizobacteria and ericoid 
mycorrhizal fungi, which play a vital role in their adaptation to soils with low 
pH and slow turnover of organic matter.

The Chinese white pine beetle is arguably the most destructive forest insect in 
the Qinling Mountains in Northern China. Little is known about the structure of 
the fungal communities associated with Dendroctonus armandi, even though this 
wood-boring insect plays important roles in ecosystem and biological invasion 
processes that result in huge economic losses in pine forests. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the fungal community structure present in the galleries 
and guts of D. armandi at different developmental stages using PCR-denaturing 
gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Analysis of PCR-amplified 18S rRNA gene 
fragments of fungi from the guts of D. armandi revealed fungal communities of 
low complexity that differed according to the developmental stage. Yeast of the 
genus Candida and the filamentous fungi Ophiostoma predominated in D. armandi 
and its galleries. In particular, Candida accounted for 56% of the fungal 
community in the pupal stage. Characterizing the evolution and content of the 
intestinal microbial community structure in D. armandi may facilitate the 
development of new pest control strategies.

Plants manipulate their rhizosphere community in a species and even a plant life 
stage-dependent manner. In essence plants select, promote and (de)activate 
directly the local bacterial and fungal community, and indirectly 
representatives of the next trophic level, protists and nematodes. By doing so, 
plants enlarge the pool of bioavailable nutrients and maximize local disease 
suppressiveness within the boundaries set by the nature of the local microbial 
community. MiSeq sequencing of specific variable regions of the 16S or 18S 
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is widely used to map microbial shifts. As current RNA 
extraction procedures are time-consuming and expensive, the rRNA-based 
characterization of the active microbial community is taken along less 
frequently. Recently, we developed a relatively fast and affordable protocol for 
the simultaneous extraction of rDNA and rRNA from soil. Here, we investigated 
the long-term impact of three type of soil management, two conventional and an 
organic regime, on soil biota in fields naturally infested with the Columbian 
root-knot nematode Meloidogyne chitwoodi with pea (Pisum sativum) as the main 
crop. For all soil samples, large differences were observed between resident 
(rDNA) and active (rRNA) microbial communities. Among the four organismal group 
under investigation, the bacterial community was most affected by the main crop, 
and unweighted and weighted UniFrac analyses (explaining respectively 16.4% and 
51.3% of the observed variation) pointed at a quantitative rather than a 
qualitative shift. LEfSe analyses were employed for each of the four organismal 
groups to taxonomically pinpoint the effects of soil management. Concentrating 
on the bacterial community in the pea rhizosphere, organic soil management 
resulted in a remarkable activation of members of the Burkholderiaceae, 
Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae. Prolonged organic soil management was 
also accompanied by significantly higher densities of bacterivorous nematodes, 
whereas levels of M. chitwoodi had dropped drastically. Though present and 
active in the fields under investigation Orbiliaceae, a family harboring 
numerous nematophagous fungi, was not associated with the M. chitwoodi decline. 
A closer look revealed that a local accumulation and activation of Pseudomonas, 
a genus that includes a number of nematode-suppressive species, paralleled the 
lower M. chitwoodi densities. This study underlines the relevance of taking 
along both resident and active fractions of multiple organismal groups while 
mapping the impact of e.g. crops and soil management regimes.

Exploring the compositional characteristics of rumen eukaryotic community can 
expand our understanding of their role in rumen function and feed efficiency. In 
this study, we applied metatranscriptomics to characterize the active rumen 
eukaryotic community (protozoa and fungi) in beef cattle (n = 48) of three 
breeds [Angus (AN), Charolais (CH), and Kinsella Composite (KC)] and with 
divergent residual feed intake (RFI). The composition of active rumen eukaryotic 
microbiota was evaluated based on enriched 18S rRNAs from the metatranscriptomic 
datasets. At the phylum level, a total of four protozoal taxa (Ciliophora, 
Parabasalia, unclassified SAR, and unclassified Alveolata), six fungal taxa 
(Neocallimastigomycota, Basidiomycota, unclassified Fungi, Mucoromycota, 
Ascomycota, and Chytridiomycota), and one sister group of kingdom Fungi 
(unclassified Opisthokonta) were detected with relative abundances higher than 
0.01% and in at least 50% of animals within each breed. Among these, Ciliophora, 
Parabasalia, unclassified Opisthokonta, and Neocallimastigomycota were the top 
four active eukaryotic phyla. At the genus level, a total of 8 ciliated 
protozoa, 5 flagellated protozoa, 5 anaerobic fungi, and 10 aerobic fungi taxa 
were detected, with unclassified Trichostomatia, Tetratrichomonas, unclassified 
Neocallimastigaceae, and Pleurotus being the most predominant taxa of ciliated 
protozoa, flagellated protozoa, anaerobic fungi, and aerobic fungi, 
respectively. Differential abundance analysis revealed that breed had a 
significant effect on the phylogenetic lineages of rumen eukaryotes, and seven 
fungal taxa were more abundant (linear discriminant analysis score > 2 with P < 
0.05) in the rumen of KC steers than in the rumen of AN and CH steers. Although 
principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed that the ruminal active eukaryotic 
profiles were not distinguishable between high- and low-RFI groups, the 
diversity indices, including Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD), observed 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and Shannon index of rumen eukaryotes were 
higher in low-RFI steers than those in high-RFI steers. Meanwhile, the abundance 
of genus Entodinium and the kingdom Fungi was higher in low-RFI steers than that 
in high-RFI steers. This information on active rumen eukaryotic microbiota and 
identified differential abundance of taxa between high- and low-RFI animals 
suggests the possibility of improving feed efficiency through altering rumen 
eukaryotic microbiota.

Psoriasis, a common cutaneous disease of unknown etiology, may be triggered by 
infections, including those due to fungi. Since the fungal community of human 
skin is poorly characterized, we aimed to analyze the mycological microbiota in 
healthy skin and psoriatic lesions. Twenty-five skin samples from five healthy 
subjects (flexor forearm) and three patients with psoriasis were analyzed using 
broad-range 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 5.8S rDNA/internal transcribed spacer 2 
(ITS2) Malassezia-specific PCR primers. Broad-range PCR analysis indicated that 
most organisms resembled Malassezia. Malassezia-specific 5.8S/ITS2 analysis of 
1,374 clones identified five species and four unknown phylotypes, potentially 
representing new species. The species distribution appears largely host specific 
and conserved in different sites of healthy skin. In three subjects, the 
Malassezia microbiota composition appeared relatively stable over time. Samples 
of Malassezia microbiota from healthy skin and psoriatic lesions were similar in 
one patient but substantially different in two others. These data indicate the 
predominance of Malassezia organisms in healthy human skin, host-specific 
variation, stability over time, and as yet, no consistent patterns 
differentiating psoriatic skin from healthy skin.

Although siderophore compounds are mainly biosynthesized as a response to iron 
deficiency in the environment, they also bind with other metals. A few studies 
have been conducted on the impact of heavy metals on the siderophore-mediated 
iron uptake by microbiome. Here, we investigated siderophore production by a 
variety of rhizosphere fungi under different concentrations of Zn²⁺ ion. These 
strains were specifically isolated from the rhizosphere of Panax ginseng (Korean 
ginseng). The siderophore production of isolated fungi was investigated with 
chrome azurol S (CAS) assay liquid media amended with different concentrations 
of Zn²⁺ (50 to 250 μg/ml). The percentage of siderophore units was quantified 
using the ultra-violet (UV) irradiation method. The results indicated that high 
concentrations of Zn²⁺ ion increase the production of siderophore in 
iron-limited cultures. Maximum siderophore production by the fungal strains was 
detected at Zn²⁺ ion concentration of 150 μg/ml except for Mortierella sp., 
which had the highest siderophore production at 200 μg/ml. One potent 
siderophore-producing strain (Penicillium sp. JJHO) was strongly influenced by 
the presence of Zn²⁺ ions and showed high identity to P. commune (100% using 
18S-rRNA sequencing). The purified siderophores of the Penicillium sp. JJHO 
strain were chemically identified using UV, Fourier-transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization 
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) spectra.

Despite the progress made in environmental microbiology techniques and 
knowledge, the succession and functional changes of the microbial community 
under multiple stressors are still poorly understood. This is a substantial 
knowledge gap as microbial communities regulate the biogeochemistry of stream 
ecosystems. Our study assessed the structural and temporal changes in stream 
fungal and bacterial communities associated with decomposing leaf litter under a 
multiple-stressor scenario. We conducted a fully crossed 4-factor experiment in 
64 flow-through mesocosms fed by a pristine montane stream (21 days of 
colonisation, 21 days of manipulations) and investigated the effects of nutrient 
enrichment, flow velocity reduction and sedimentation after 2 and 3 weeks of 
stressor exposure. We used high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding 
techniques (16S and 18S rRNA genes) to identify changes in microbial community 
composition. Our results indicate that (1) shifts in relative abundances of the 
pre-existing terrestrial microbial community, rather than changes in community 
identity, drove the observed responses to stressors; (2) changes in relative 
abundances within the microbial community paralleled decomposition rate patterns 
with time; (3) both fungal and bacterial communities had a certain resistance to 
stressors, as indicated by relatively minor changes in alpha diversity or 
multivariate community structure; (4) overall, stressor interactions were more 
common than stressor main effects when affecting microbial diversity metrics or 
abundant individual genera; and (5) stressor effects on microbes often changed 
from 2 weeks to 3 weeks of stressor exposure, with several response patterns 
being reversed. Our study suggests that future research should focus more on 
understanding the temporal dynamics of fungal and bacterial communities and how 
they relate to ecosystem processes to advance our understanding of the 
mechanisms associated with multiple-stressor interactions.

The largest biological surface on earth is formed by plant leaves. These leaf 
surfaces are colonized by a specialized suite of leaf-inhabiting microorganisms, 
recently termed "phyllosphere microbiome". Microbial prey, however, attract 
microbial predators. Protists in particular have been shown to structure 
bacterial communities on plant surfaces, but virtually nothing is known about 
the community composition of protists on leaves. Using newly designed specific 
primers targeting the 18S rDNA gene of Cercozoa, we investigated the species 
richness of this common protist group on leaves of four Brassicaceae species 
from two different locations in a cloning-based approach. The generated 
sequences revealed a broad diversity of leaf-associated Cercozoa, mostly 
bacterial feeders, but also including known plant pathogens and a taxon of 
potential endophytes that were recently described as algal predators in 
freshwater systems. This initial study shows that protists must be regarded as 
an integral part of the microbial diversity in the phyllosphere of plants.

The yeast Pseudozyma antarctica secretes a concentrated biodegradable plastic 
(BP)-degrading enzyme when cultivated with xylose. Treatment with the culture 
filtrate reduced the puncture strength of commercial BP mulch films. After 
burying the film in soil, the residual amount of solid film was reduced 
significantly, and none was recovered after 5 weeks. The dynamics of soil fungal 
communities were analyzed weekly after burying the film using 18S rDNA 
polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) 
profiling of soil DNA. In the soil containing enzyme-treated film, the native 
community essentially recovered within 24 weeks. In comparison, the untreated 
solid film remained in the soil for 12 weeks and the response of the soil-fungal 
community was relatively slow; it had not recovered within 24 weeks.

Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) caused by water column stratification appear to 
expand in parts of the world's ocean, with consequences for marine 
biogeochemical cycles. OMZ formation is often fueled by high surface primary 
production, and sinking organic particles can be hotspots of interactions and 
activity within microbial communities. This study investigated the diversity of 
OMZ protist communities in two biomass size fractions (>30 and 30-1.6 μm 
filters) from the world's largest permanent OMZ in the Eastern Tropical North 
Pacific. Diversity was quantified via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of V4 region of 
18S SSU rRNA genes in samples spanning oxygen gradients at two stations. 
Alveolata and Rhizaria dominated the two size fractions at both sites along the 
oxygen gradient. Community composition at finer taxonomic levels was partially 
shaped by oxygen concentration, as communities associated with versus anoxic 
waters shared only ∼32% of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (97% sequence 
identity) composition. Overall, only 9.7% of total OTUs were recovered at both 
stations and under all oxygen conditions sampled, implying structuring of the 
eukaryotic community in this area. Size-fractionated communities exhibited 
different taxonomical features (e.g. Syndiniales Group I in the 1.6-30 μm 
fraction) that could be explained by the microniches created on the 
surface-originated sinking particles.

Microbiomes represent the collective bacteria, archaea, protist, fungi, and 
virus communities living in or on individual organisms that are typically 
multicellular eukaryotes. Such consortia have become recognized as having 
significant impacts on the development, health, and disease status of their 
hosts. Since understanding the mechanistic connections between an individual's 
genetic makeup and their complete set of traits (i.e., genome to phenome) 
requires consideration at different levels of biological organization, this 
should include interactions with, and the organization of, microbial consortia. 
To understand microbial consortia organization, we elucidated the genetic 
constituents amongst phenotypically similar (and hypothesized 
functionally-analogous) layers (i.e., top orange, second orange, pink, and green 
layers) in the unique laminated orange cyanobacterial-bacterial crusts endemic 
to Hawaii's anchialine ecosystem. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of 
ribosomal RNA hypervariable regions (i.e., Bacteria-specific V6 and 
Eukarya-biased V9) revealed microbial richness increasing by crust layer depth, 
with samples of a given layer more similar to different layers from the same 
geographic site than to their phenotypically-analogous layer from different 
sites. Furthermore, samples from sites on the same island were more similar to 
each other, regardless of which layer they originated from, than to analogous 
layers from another island. However, cyanobacterial and algal taxa were abundant 
in all surface and bottom layers, with anaerobic and chemoautotrophic taxa 
concentrated in the middle two layers, suggesting crust oxygenation from both 
above and below. Thus, the arrangement of oxygenated vs. anoxygenated niches in 
these orange crusts are functionally distinct relative to other laminated 
cyanobacterial-bacterial communities examined to date, with convergent evolution 
due to similar environmental conditions a likely driver for these phenotypically 
comparable but genetically distinct microbial consortia.

AIMS: To identify the microbiota in meju, fermented cooked soya beans, that may 
directly affect the microbial communities of Korean fermented soya bean foods.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using conventional bacterial 16S rDNA, bacilli-specific 16S 
rDNA or fungi 18S rDNA-specific primers, PCR products were amplified through a 
series of PCRs using the DNA extracted from ten meju samples. The amplicons were 
analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which showed that 
Enterococcus durans was commonly detected in nine of ten meju samples. Bacillus 
subtilis was shown to be the major strain of bacilli in the samples tested. 
Based on the DGGE analysis of fungi in meju, we determined that Absidia 
corymbifera, Aspergillus sp. and Candida rugosa were the main fungi in the 
tested samples.
CONCLUSIONS: A variety of bacterial and fungal micro-organisms were identified 
in meju samples, in addition to the micro-organisms already known to be present.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report showing the 
differences and similarities in the populations of micro-organisms in meju 
samples using nested PCR-DGGE, a culture-independent method. The results may be 
applicable to the development of improved meju, in which the indigenous 
micro-organisms required for fermentation can be standardized.

Elucidating arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal responses to elevation changes is 
critical to improve understanding of microbial function in ecosystems under 
global asymmetrical climate change scenarios. Here we examined AM fungal 
community in a two-year reciprocal translocation of vegetation-intact soil 
blocks along an altitudinal gradient (3,200 m to 3,800 m) in an alpine meadow on 
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. AM fungal spore density was significantly higher at 
lower elevation than at higher elevation regardless of translocation, except 
that this parameter was significantly increased by upward translocation from 
original 3,200 m to 3,400 m and 3,600 m. Seventy-three operational taxonomic 
units (OTUs) of AM fungi were recovered using 454-pyrosequencing of 18S rDNA 
sequences at a 97% sequence similarity. Original elevation, downward 
translocation and upward translocation did not significantly affect AM fungal 
OTU richness. However, with increasing altitude the OTU richness of 
Acaulosporaceae and Ambisporaceae increased, but the OTU richness of 
Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae decreased generally. The AM fungal community 
composition was significantly structured by original elevation but not by 
downward translocation and upward translocation. Our findings highlight that 
compared with the short-term reciprocal translocation, original elevation is a 
stronger determinant in shaping AM fungal community in the Qinghai-Tibet alpine 
meadow.

Olive ridley sea turtle hatching success as a function of the microbial 
abundance in nest sand at Ostional, Costa Rica.

Several studies have suggested that significant embryo mortality is caused by 
microbes, while high microbial loads are generated by the decomposition of eggs 
broken by later nesting turtles. This occurs commonly when nesting density is 
high, especially during mass nesting events (arribadas). However, no previous 
research has directly quantified microbial abundance and the associated effects 
on sea turtle hatching success at a nesting beach. The aim of this study was to 
test the hypothesis that the microbial abundance in olive ridley sea turtle nest 
sand affects the hatching success at Ostional, Costa Rica. We applied 
experimental treatments to alter the microbial abundance within the sand into 
which nests were relocated. We monitored temperature, oxygen, and organic matter 
content throughout the incubation period and quantified the microbial abundance 
within the nest sand using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
molecular analysis. The most successful treatment in increasing hatching success 
was the removal and replacement of nest sand. We found a negative correlation 
between hatching success and fungal abundance (fungal 18S rRNA gene copies g(-1) 
nest sand). Of secondary importance in determining hatching success was the 
abundance of bacteria (bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies g(-1) g(-1) nest sand). 
Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that high microbial activity is 
responsible for the lower hatching success observed at Ostional beach. 
Furthermore, the underlying mechanism appears to be the deprivation of oxygen 
and exposure to higher temperatures resulting from microbial decomposition in 
the nest.

In this study, metagenomics was applied to characterize the microbial community 
and to discover carbohydrate-active genes of an enriched thermophilic 
cellulose-degrading sludge. The 16S analysis showed that the sludge microbiome 
was dominated by genus of cellulolytic Clostridium and methanogenesis 
Methanothermobacter. In order to retrieve genes from the metagenome, de novo 
assembly of the 11,930,760 Illumina 100 bp paired-end reads (totally 1.2 Gb) was 
carried out. 75% of all reads was utilized in the de novo assembly. 31,499 ORFs 
(Open Reading Frame) with an average length of 852 bp were predicted from the 
assembly; and 64% of these ORFs were predicted to present full-length genes. 
Based on the Hidden Markol Model, 253 of the predicted thermo-stable genes were 
identified as putatively carbohydrate-active. Among them the relative dominance 
of GH9 (Glycoside Hydrolase) and corresponding CBM3 (Carbohydrate Binding 
Module) revealed a cellulosome-based attached metabolism of polysaccharide in 
the thermophilic sludge. The putative carbohydrate-active genes ranged from 20% 
to 100% amino acid sequence identity to known proteins in NCBI nr database, with 
half of them showed less than 50% similarity. In addition, the coverage of the 
genes (in terms of ORFs) identified in the sludge were developed into three 
clear trends (112×, 29× and 8×) in which 85% of the high coverage trend (112×) 
mainly consisted of phylum of Firmicutes while 49.3% of the 29× trend was 
affiliated to the phylum of Chloroflexi.

During the assessments of the correlation of the diseases and the microbiota of 
various clinical specimens, unique 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences (less 
than 80% similarity to known bacterial type strains) were predominantly detected 
in a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimen from a patient with chronic 
lower respiratory tract infection. The origin of this unique sequence is 
suspected to be the causative agent of the infection. We temporarily named the 
owner organism of this sequence "IOLA" (Infectious Organism Lurking in Airways). 
In order to evaluate the significance of IOLA in human lung disorders, we 
performed several experiments. IOLA-16S rRNA genes were detected in 6 of 386 
clone libraries constructed from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory 
diseases (in our study series). The gene sequences (1,427 bp) are identical, and 
no significantly similar sequence was found in public databases (using NCBI 
blastn) except for the 8 shorter sequences detected from patients with 
respiratory diseases in other studies from 2 other countries. Phylogenetic 
analyses revealed that the 16S rRNA gene of IOLA is more closely related to 
eukaryotic mitochondria than bacteria. However, the size and shape of IOLA seen 
by fluorescent in-situ hybridization are similar to small bacteria 
(approximately 1 µm with a spherical shape). Furthermore, features of both 
bacteria and mitochondria were observed in the genomic fragment (about 19 kb) of 
IOLA, and the GC ratio of the sequence was extremely low (20.5%). Two main 
conclusions were reached: (1) IOLA is a novel bacteria-like microorganism that, 
interestingly, possesses features of eukaryotic mitochondria. (2) IOLA is a 
novel pathogen candidate, and it may be the causative agent of human lung or 
airway disease. IOLA exists in BALF specimens from patients with remarkable 
symptoms; this information is an important piece for helping solve the elusive 
etiology of chronic respiratory disorders.

Snow algae blooms cover vast areas of summer snowfields worldwide, reducing 
albedo and increasing snow melt. Despite their global prevalence, little is 
known about the algae species that comprise these blooms. We used 18S and rbcL 
metabarcoding and light microscopy to characterize algae species composition in 
31 snow algae blooms in the Coast Range of British Columbia, Canada. This study 
is the first to thoroughly document regional variation between blooms. We found 
all blooms were dominated by the genera Sanguina, Chloromonas, and Chlainomonas. 
There was considerable variation between blooms, most notably species 
assemblages above treeline were distinct from forested sites. In contrast to 
previous studies, the snow algae genus Chlainomonas was abundant and widespread 
in snow algae blooms. We found few taxa using traditional 18S metabarcoding, but 
the high taxonomic resolution of rbcL revealed substantial diversity, including 
OTUs that likely represent unnamed species of snow algae. These three 
cross-referenced datasets (rbcL, 18S, and microscopy) reveal that alpine snow 
algae blooms are more diverse than previously thought, with different species of 
algae dominating different elevations.

The gut microbiota of termites allows them to thrive on a variety of different 
materials such as wood, litter, and soil. For that reason, they play important 
roles in the decomposition of biomass in diverse biomes. This function is 
essential in the savanna, where litter-feeding termites are one of the few 
invertebrates active during the dry season. In this study, we describe the gut 
microbiota of workers (third and fourth instars) of the species Syntermes 
wheeleri, a litter-feeding termite from the Brazilian savanna. Results of 16S 
and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-targeted pyrosequencing using primers sets 
specific to each domain have revealed its bacterial, archaeal, and fungal 
diversities. Firmicutes accounted for more than half of the operational 
taxonomic units of the Bacteria domain. The most abundant fungal species were 
from the class Dothideomycetes of the phylum Ascomycota. The methanogenic orders 
Methanobacteriales, Methanosarcinales, and Methanomicrobiales of the phylum 
Euryarchaeota accounted for the greatest part of the Archaea detected in this 
termite. A comparison of the gut microbiota of the two instars revealed a 
difference in operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance but not in species 
richness. This description of the whole gut microbiota represents the first 
study to evaluate relationships among bacteria, archaea, fungi, and host in S. 
wheeleri.

The relationships between vermicompost chemical features, enzyme activities, 
community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs), fungal community structures, and 
its microbial respiratory response to pesticides were investigated. Fungal 
community structure of vermicomposts produced from damaged tomato fruits (DT), 
winery wastes (WW), olive-mill waste and biosolids (OB), and cattle manure (CM) 
were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 18S rDNA. 
MicroResp™ was used for assessing vermicompost CLPPs and testing the microbial 
response to metalaxyl, imidacloprid, and diuron. Vermicompost enzyme activities 
and CLPPs indicated that WW, OB, and DT had higher microbial functional 
diversity than CM. The microbiota of the former tolerated all three pesticides 
whereas microbial respiration in CM was negatively affected by metalaxyl and 
imidacloprid. The response of vermicompost microbiota to the fungicide metalaxyl 
was correlated to its fungal community structure. The results suggest that 
vermicomposts with higher microbial functional diversity can be useful for the 
management of pesticide pollution in agriculture.

BACKGROUND: Apicomplexans are the causative agents of major human diseases such 
as malaria and toxoplasmosis. A novel group of apicomplexans, recently named 
corallicolids, have been detected in corals inhabiting tropical shallow reefs. 
These apicomplexans may represent a transitional lifestyle between free-living 
phototrophs and obligate parasites. To shed light on the evolutionary history of 
apicomplexans and to investigate their ecology in association with corals, we 
screened scleractinians, antipatharians, alcyonaceans, and zoantharians from 
shallow, mesophotic, and deep-sea communities. We detected corallicolid plastids 
using 16S metabarcoding, sequenced the nuclear 18S rRNA gene of corallicolids 
from selected samples, assembled and annotated the plastid and mitochondrial 
genomes from a corallicolid that associates with a deep-sea coral, and screened 
the metagenomes of four coral species for corallicolids.
RESULTS: We detected 23 corallicolid plastotypes that were associated with 14 
coral species from three orders and depths down to 1400 m. Individual 
plastotypes were restricted to coral hosts within a single depth zone and within 
a single taxonomic order of corals. Some clusters of closely related 
corallicolids were revealed that associated with closely related coral species. 
However, the presence of divergent corallicolid lineages that associated with 
similar coral species and depths suggests that corallicolid/coral relations are 
flexible over evolutionary timescales and that a large diversity of 
apicomplexans may remain undiscovered. The corallicolid plastid genome from a 
deep-sea coral contained four genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis: the 
three genes of the LIPOR complex and acsF.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of corallicolid apicomplexans in corals below the 
photic zone demonstrates that they are not restricted to shallow-water reefs and 
are more general anthozoan symbionts. The presence of LIPOR genes in the 
deep-sea corallicolid precludes a role involving photosynthesis and suggests 
they may be involved in a different function. Thus, these genes may represent 
another set of genetic tools whose function was adapted from photosynthesis as 
the ancestors of apicomplexans evolved towards parasitic lifestyles. Video

The treatment performance of ibuprofen (IBP)-enriched wastewater by horizontal 
subsurface flow constructed wetlands planted with cattail (Typha angustifolia) 
and unplanted control mesocosms was investigated. Removal efficiencies of IBP 
were significantly (p < .05) enhanced in the planted mesocosms (78.5%) compared 
to those in the unplanted beds (57.9%). An 18S rRNA gene high-throughput 
pyrosequencing approach was used to investigate the effects of IBP on the 
structure of the fungal community in these wetland systems. The overall 
diversity of the fungal community was reduced under the IBP exposure. Taxonomic 
analysis revealed that 62.2% of the fungal sequences were affiliated with 
Basidiomycota, followed by Ascomycota (37.4%) at the phylum level. Uncultured 
fungus (48.2%), Chaetomium sp. (14.2%), Aspergillus sp. (12.4%), Trichoderma sp. 
(5.7%), Cladosporium sp. (5.4%), and Emericellopsis sp. (5.2%) were identified 
as dominant genera. At the genus level, a distinct profile of the fungal 
community in the IBP-enriched mesocosms was observed as compared to the control 
beds, and as well specific fungal genera were enhanced in the planted beds, 
regardless of IBP enrichment. However, despite these differences, the 
composition of the fungal community (as measured by Bray-Curtis similarity) was 
mostly unaffected by the significant IBP enrichment. On the other hand, a 
consistent similarity pattern of fungal community structure in the planted 
mesocosms suggests that the presence of higher macrophytes in the wetland 
systems may well help shape the fungal community structure.

Molasses alcohol wastewater (MAW) is difficult to be bio-treated and converted 
into biogas. In this study, MAW mixed with pig manure (PM) in different ratios 
was co-digested. Biogas production, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and the 
structure of microbial communities were monitored in the process. Our results 
showed that under the optimal COD ratio of PM:MAW (1.0:1.5), CODremoval and 
biogas yield were the highest. And in fermentation tanks with different PM to 
MAW ratios, the structure and composition of bacterial communities varied in the 
early and late stage. Furthermore, the type of main bacterial operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs) have no differences, yet the relative abundance of OTUs 
varied. The current research showed that there was a good potential to the use 
of PM as a co-digested material to anaerobic treatment of MAW and provided 
references for further improving bio-treatment of MAW.

A broad spectrum of fungal antagonists was evaluated as potential biocontrol 
agents (BCAs) against the soil-borne pathogen Rhizoctonia solani using a new 
combination of in vitro and in vivo assays. The in vitro characterisation of 
diverse parameters including the ability to parasitise mycelium and to inhibit 
the germination of Rhizoctonia sclerotia at different temperatures resulted in 
the selection of six potential fungal antagonists. These were genotypically 
characterised by their BOX-PCR fingerprints, and identified as Trichoderma 
reesei and T. viride by partial 18S rDNA sequencing. When potato sprouts were 
treated with Trichoderma, all isolates significantly reduced the incidence of 
Rhizoctonia symptoms. Evaluated under growth chamber conditions, the selected 
Trichoderma isolates either partly or completely controlled the dry mass loss of 
lettuce caused by R. solani. Furthermore, the antagonistic Trichoderma strains 
were active under field conditions. To analyse the effect of Trichoderma 
treatment on indigenous root-associated microbial communities, we performed a 
DNA-dependent SSCP (Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism) analysis of 16S 
rDNA/ITS sequences. In this first assessment study for Trichoderma it was shown 
that the pathogen and the vegetation time had much more influence on the 
composition of the microbiota than the BCA treatment. After evaluation of all 
results, three Trichoderma strains originally isolated from Rhizoctonia 
sclerotia were selected as promising BCAs.

A new urostylid ciliate, Anteholosticha songi nov. spec., isolated from forest 
soil in Tibet, and an American population of Holosticha pullaster (Müller, 1773) 
Foissner et al., 1991, isolated from a freshwater pond in the USA, are 
investigated in terms of their morphology, ontogenesis, and molecular biology. 
Anteholosticha songi nov. spec. is characterized by a slender to ellipsoidal 
body measuring 160-205 × 40-55 μm in vivo; rod-shaped yellowish cortical 
granules arranged in irregular short rows; four dorsal kineties; adoral zone 
consisting of 35-40 membranelles; three frontal, one buccal, one parabuccal, two 
frontoterminal, two pretransverse, and four to six transverse cirri and 14-25 
midventral pairs; 12-22 ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules longitudinally arranged 
in pairs left of cell mid-line. Supplemental information on morphogenesis in 
Holosticha pullaster is also presented. The phylogenetic relationship of 
Anteholosticha and Holosticha inferred from SSU rDNA sequence data are 
concordant with previous studies and showing that Holosticha is monophyletic 
whereas Anteholosticha is polyphyletic and should be split into two or more 
genera.

The application of Atrazine in soil has always been a main problem in 
agriculture because its residuals may maintain in the soil for a long term. In 
this paper, two strains of Atrazine degrading bacteria (Klebsiella sp. FH-1 and 
Arthrobacter sp. NJ-1) were used to make biological compound microbial inoculum 
to repair the Atrazine contaminated typical black soil in Northeast China. Grain 
chaff was chosen as the optimal carrier material for microbial inoculum. The 
dynamic changes of Atrazine were detected by gas chromatography. The half-life 
of Atrazine in soil containing microbial inoculum was shortened from 9.8 d to 
4.2 d. The Atrazine sensitive crops grown in the repaired soil showed increased 
stem length, root length, and emergence rate. The effects of microbial 
remediation on the original bacterial and fungal biota in the typical black soil 
in Northeast China were analyzed using the metagenomic approach. Results showed 
that Atrazine inhibited the original bacteria and fungi populations. The total 
numbers of bacterial and fungal species in the soil were partially recovered by 
adding the microbial inoculum. Two genera (Sphingosinicella and Sphingomonas) 
were the dominant bacteria. The beneficial bacterial biota was recovered and the 
number of species of the beneficial bacteria was higher than that in the 
original soil after adding the microbial inoculum. The dominant fungi included 
genera Guehomyces and Chaetomella. There was a total of 113 unclassified fungal 
genera (22.6% of 499), indicating the potential utility of the unclassified 
fungal species in the assessment of the soil contamination by Atrazine.

Role of eukaryotic microbiota in soil survival and catabolic performance of the 
2,4-D herbicide degrading bacteria Cupriavidus necator JMP134.

Cupriavidus necator (formerly Ralstonia eutropha) JMP134, harbouring the 
catabolic plasmid pJP4, is the best-studied 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 
(2,4-D) herbicide degrading bacterium. A study of the survival and catabolic 
performance of strain JMP134 in agricultural soil microcosms exposed to high 
levels of 2,4-D was carried out. When C. necator JMP134 was introduced into soil 
microcosms, the rate of 2,4-D removal increased only slightly. This correlated 
with the poor survival of the strain, as judged by 16S rRNA gene terminal 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles, and the 
semi-quantitative detection of the pJP4-borne tfdA gene sequence, encoding the 
first step in 2,4-D degradation. After 3 days of incubation in irradiated soil 
microcosms, the survival of strain JMP134 dramatically improved and the 
herbicide was completely removed. The introduction of strain JMP134 into native 
soil microcosms did not produce detectable changes in the structure of the 
bacterial community, as judged by 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiles, but provoked a 
transient increase of signals putatively corresponding to protozoa, as indicated 
by 18S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiling. Accordingly, a ciliate able to feed on C. 
necator JMP134 could be isolated after soil enrichment. In native soil 
microcosms, C. necator JMP134 survived better than Escherichia coli DH5alpha 
(pJP4) and similarly to Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (pJP4), indicating that 
species specific factors control the survival of strains harbouring pJP4. The 
addition of cycloheximide to soil microcosms strongly improved survival of these 
three strains, indicating that the eukaryotic microbiota has a strong negative 
effect in bioaugmentation with catabolic bacteria.

Complexity in natural microbial ecosystems: the Guerrero Negro experience.

The goal of this project is to describe and understand the organismal 
composition, structure, and physiology of microbial ecosystems from hypersaline 
environments. One collection of such ecosystems occurs at North America's 
largest saltworks, the Exportadora de Sal, in Guerrero Negro, Baja California 
Sur. There, seawater flows through a series of evaporative basins with an 
increase in salinity until saturation is reached and halite crystallization 
begins. Several of these ponds are lined with thick (10 cm) microbial mats that 
have received some biological study. To determine the nature and extent of 
diversity of the microbial organisms that constitute these ecosystems, we are 
conducting a phylogenetic analysis using molecular approaches, based on cloning 
and sequencing of small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes (16S for Bacteria and Archaea, 
18S for Eukarya). In addition, we report preliminary results on the microbial 
composition of a laminated community that occurs in a crystallized gypsum-halite 
matrix in near-saturated salt water. Exposure of the interior of these large 
(kilogram) wet, endoevaporite crystals reveals a multitude of colors: layers of 
yellow, green, pink, and purple microbiota. To date, analyses of these two 
environments indicate the ubiquitous dominance of uncultured organisms of

Fungi form a diverse microbial community in the human intestine. Little is known 
about the succession of species after intestinal transplantation. We 
investigated the alterations of the gut fungal population in 2 patients with 
intestinal allografts. The ileal effluent and feces were fingerprinted using 
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, with confirmation by DNA sequencing. 
Analysis of 18S ribosomal DNA indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the 
fungal communities was higher soon after transplantation; less diversity was 
observed at the later time points in patient 1. The shifts in the denaturing 
gradient gel electrophoresis banding patterns over time were similar in the 
effluent and feces in this patient. Similar changes in the fungi in the effluent 
and feces also were observed in patient 2. Sequence analysis of denaturing 
gradient gel electrophoresis bands showed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 
Kluyveromyces waltii dominated the fungal microbiota in both patients. Some 
species, including Candida spp, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium oxysporum, 
Aspergillus clavatus, and Trichophyton verrucosum, were present early. We report 
for the first time the temporal alterations in fungal communities in patients 
with an intestinal allograft. This information may provide novel insight into 
the roles of the fungal microbiota in the pathophysiology of the transplanted 
intestine.

Although mutualistic associations between animals and microbial symbionts are 
widespread in nature, the mechanisms that have promoted their evolutionary 
persistence remain poorly understood. A vertical mode of symbiont transmission 
(from parents to offspring) is thought to ensure partner fidelity and 
stabilization, although the efficiency of vertical transmission has rarely been 
investigated, especially in cases where hosts harbour a diverse microbial 
community. Here we evaluated vertical transmission rates of cellulolytic gut 
oxymonad and parabasalid protists in the wood-feeding termite Reticulitermes 
grassei. We sequenced amplicons of the 18S rRNA gene of protists from 24 
colonies of R. grassei collected in two populations. For each colony, the 
protist community was characterized from the gut of 14 swarming reproductives 
and from a pool of 10 worker guts. A total of 98 operational taxonomic units 
belonging to 13 species-level taxa were found. The vertical transmission rate 
was estimated for each protist present in a colony based on its frequency among 
the reproductives. The results revealed that transmission rates were high, with 
an average of 0.897 (±0.164) per protist species. Overall, the protist community 
did not differ between reproductive sexes, suggesting that both the queen and 
the king could contribute to the gut microbiota of the offspring. A positive 
relationship between the transmission rate of protists and their prevalence 
within populations was also detected. However, transmission rates alone do not 
explain the prevalence of protists. In conclusion, these findings reveal key 
forces behind a conserved, multispecies mutualism, raising further questions on 
the roles of horizontal transfer and negative selection in shaping symbiont 
prevalence.

Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex mixture of carboxylic acids present in oil 
sands process water (OSPW). Their recalcitrant nature makes them difficult to be 
removed from the environment using conventional remediation strategies. This 
study hypothesized that, upon continuous operation, biofiltration of OSPW in 
fixed-bed biofilm reactors would allow the development of NA-degrading microbial 
community within the biofilter following successful removal. Both raw and 
ozonated OSPW were treated in the biofilters and changes in microbial community 
were tested via 16S/18S amplicon sequencing and metatranscriptomics. Through 
switch from suspended growth to attached growth, a shift in indigenous microbial 
community was seen following by an increase in alpha diversity. Concomitantly, 
improved degradation of NAs was monitored, i.e., 35.8% and 69.4% of NAs were 
removed from raw and ozonated OSPW, respectively. Metatranscriptomics analysis 
suggested the presence of genes involved in the degradation of organic acids and 
petroleum-related compounds. Specifically, functional abundance of aromatic 
compounds' metabolism improved from 0.05% to 0.76%; whereas abundance of 
benzoate transport and degradation pathway increased from 0.04% to 0.64%. These 
changes conclude that continuous operation of OSPW in the bioreactors was in 
favor of shaping the overall microbiome towards better NA degradation.

Evidence indicates that the densely cultivated region of northeastern China acts 
as a source for the wind-borne agent of Kawasaki disease (KD). KD is an acute, 
coronary artery vasculitis of young children, and still a medical mystery after 
more than 40 y. We used residence times from simulations with the flexible 
particle dispersion model to pinpoint the source region for KD. Simulations were 
generated from locations spanning Japan from days with either high or low KD 
incidence. The postepidemic interval (1987-2010) and the extreme epidemics 
(1979, 1982, and 1986) pointed to the same source region. Results suggest a very 
short incubation period (<24 h) from exposure, thus making an infectious agent 
unlikely. Sampling campaigns over Japan during the KD season detected major 
differences in the microbiota of the tropospheric aerosols compared with ground 
aerosols, with the unexpected finding of the Candida species as the dominant 
fungus from aloft samples (54% of all fungal strains). These results, consistent 
with the Candida animal model for KD, provide support for the concept and 
feasibility of a windborne pathogen. A fungal toxin could be pursued as a 
possible etiologic agent of KD, consistent with an agricultural source, a short 
incubation time and synchronized outbreaks. Our study suggests that the 
causative agent of KD is a preformed toxin or environmental agent rather than an 
organism requiring replication. We propose a new paradigm whereby an 
idiosyncratic immune response, influenced by host genetics triggered by an 
environmental exposure carried on winds, results in the clinical syndrome known 
as acute KD.

The eukaryotic biodiversity in historical air-dried samples of Dutch 
agricultural soil has been assessed by random sequencing of an 18S rRNA gene 
library and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Representatives of 
nearly all taxa of eukaryotic soil microbes could be identified, demonstrating 
that it is possible to study eukaryotic microbiota in samples from soil archives 
that have been stored for more than 30 years at room temperature. In a pilot 
study, 41 sequences were retrieved that could be assigned to fungi and a variety 
of aerobic and anaerobic protists such as cercozoans, ciliates, xanthophytes 
(stramenopiles), heteroloboseans, and amoebozoans. A PCR-denaturing gradient gel 
electrophoresis analysis of samples collected between 1950 and 1975 revealed 
significant changes in the composition of the eukaryotic microbiota.

Assessment of the abundance of fungi in environmental samples by quantitative 
PCR (qPCR) of community DNA is often a difficult task due to biases introduced 
during PCR amplification, resulting from the differences associated with length 
polymorphism and the varying number of copies of the rRNA operon among fungal 
species, the lack of specificity of the primers targeting the different regions 
of the rRNA operon, or their insufficient coverage of the fungal lineages. To 
overcome those limitations, it is crucial to test and select the specific 
primers sets which provide the more accurate approximation to the quantification 
of the targeted fungal populations in a given set of samples. Fungi are a 
significant fraction of the microbiota in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), 
but the activated sludge microbial communities comprise many other eukaryotic 
microorganisms whose molecular markers are often coamplified by primers 
initially designed as fungal-specific. Here, the use of the FungiQuant primer 
set is recommended for the quantification of fungal molecular markers (18S rRNA 
genes) by qPCR in activated sludge samples and the full protocol is described.

Methane produced from 35 Aberdeen-Angus and 33 Limousin cross steers was 
measured in respiration chambers. Each group was split to receive either a 
medium- or high-concentrate diet. Ruminal digesta samples were subsequently 
removed to investigate correlations between methane emissions and the rumen 
microbial community, as measured by qPCR of 16S or 18S rRNA genes. Diet had the 
greatest influence on methane emissions. The high-concentrate diet resulted in 
lower methane emissions (P < 0.001) than the medium-concentrate diet. Methane 
was correlated, irrespective of breed, with the abundance of archaea (R = 0.39), 
bacteria (-0.47), protozoa (0.45), Bacteroidetes (-0.37) and Clostridium Cluster 
XIVa (-0.35). The archaea:bacteria ratio provided a stronger correlation (0.49). 
A similar correlation was found with digesta samples taken 2-3 weeks later at 
slaughter. This finding could help enable greenhouse gas emissions of large 
animal cohorts to be predicted from samples taken conveniently in the abattoir.

The short-term response of the resident soil bacterial and fungal communities to 
the addition of 5% (w/w) of either dry olive mill residue (DOR), DOR treated 
with Phlebia sp. (PTDOR) or DOR previously extracted with water (WEDOR) was 
investigated. As opposed to bacteria, the diversity of fungi increased upon the 
amendments as assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 18S rDNA. 
Over the first 30 days, phospholipid fatty acids analyses indicated a gradual 
decrease in the relative abundances of gram(+) bacteria (from 44.8% to 37.9%) 
and a concomitant increase of gram(-) bacteria (from 37.3% to 51.2%) in 
DOR-amended soil. A considerable increase in the fungal/bacterial ratio was 
observed after 7 days in DOR, WEDOR and PTDOR-amended soils with respect to the 
control (0.316, 0.165 and 0.265, respectively, vs. 0.011). The overall microbial 
activity was stimulated by the amendments as indicated by the higher activity 
levels of both dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate hydrolase. These results 
indicate that DOR at the application level examined is not toxic on soil 
microorganisms.
