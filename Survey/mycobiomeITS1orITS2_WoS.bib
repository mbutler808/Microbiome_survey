Title = {{Effects of nebulized dexamethasone on the respiratory microbiota and

   of asthma}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Background Prolonged exposure to environmental antigens or allergens
   elicits an immune response in both healthy horses and those with mild
   asthma. Corticosteroids often are used to treat lower airway
   inflammation. Objective To investigate the changes in equine herpesvirus
   (EHV)-1,2,4,5 glycoprotein B gene expression and changes in respiratory
   bacterial and fungal communities after nebulized dexamethasone treatment
   of horses with asthma. Animals Horses with naturally occurring mild
   asthma (n = 16) and healthy control horses (n = 4). Methods Prospective,
   randomized, controlled, blinded clinical trial. Polymerase chain
   reaction amplification of EHV-1,2,4,5 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
   and 16S (microbiome) and ITS2 (mycobiome) genes with subsequent
   sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from nasal swabs and
   transendoscopic tracheal aspirates before and after 13 days treatment
   with nebulized dexamethasone (15 mg q24h) and saline (control). Results
   Nebulized dexamethasone treatment decreased microbial diversity;
   relative abundance of 8 genera in the upper respiratory tract were
   altered. For both the microbiota and the mycobiota, environment had a
   dominant effect over treatment. Alternaria, an opportunistic pathogen
   and allergen in humans recognized as a risk factor for asthma, asthma
   severity, and exacerbations, was increased with treatment. Treatment
   affected relative quantification of the equine gamma herpesviruses
   (EHV-2 and -5); EHV-2 DNA levels increased and those of EHV-5 decreased.
   Conclusions Nebulized dexamethasone treatment affected the upper
   respiratory tract microbiota, but not the mycobiota, which was
   overwhelmed by the effect of a sustained dusty environment.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi play an important role in cycling organic matter and nutrients in
   marine ecosystems. However, the distribution of fungal communities in
   the ocean, especially the vertical distribution along depth in the water
   column, remained poorly understood. Here, we assess the depth-related
   distribution pattern of fungal communities along the water column from
   epi- to abyssopelagic zones of the Western Pacific Ocean using internal
   transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) metabarcoding. Majority of the assigned OTUs
   were affiliated to Ascomycota, followed by three other minor phyla
   (Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycota). The epipelagic zone
   harbored a higher OTU richness with distinct fungal communities as
   compared with meso-, bathy-, and abyssopelagic zones. Across the whole
   water column, depth appears as a key parameter for both fungal alpha-
   and beta-diversity. However, when the dataset was split into the upper
   (5-500 m) and deeper (below 500 m) layers, no significant correlation
   was observed between depth and community compositions. In the upper
   layer, temperature and dissolved oxygen were recognized as the primary
   environmental factors shaping fungal alpha- and beta- diversity. By
   parsing fungal OTUs into ecological categories, multi-trophic mode of
   nutrition was found to be more prevalent with increasing depth,
   suggesting a potential adaptation to the extreme conditions of the deep
   sea. This study provides new and meaningful information on the
   depth-stratified fungal diversity, community structure, and putative
   ecological roles in the open sea.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hispanics living in the USA may have unrecognized potential
   birthplace and lifestyle influences on the gut microbiome. We report a
   cross-sectional analysis of 1674 participants from four centers of the
   Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), aged 18 to
   74 years old at recruitment. Results: Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA
   gene V4 and fungal ITS1 fragments from self-collected stool samples
   indicate that the host microbiome is determined by sociodemographic and
   migration-related variables. Those who relocate from Latin America to
   the USA at an early age have reductions in Prevotella to Bacteroides
   ratios that persist across the life course. Shannon index of alpha
   diversity in fungi and bacteria is low in those who relocate to the USA
   in early life. In contrast, those who relocate to the USA during
   adulthood, over 45 years old, have high bacterial and fungal diversity
   and high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios, compared to USA-born and
   childhood arrivals. Low bacterial diversity is associated in turn with
   obesity. Contrasting with prior studies, our study of the Latino
   population shows increasing Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio with greater
   obesity. Taxa within Acidaminococcus, Megasphaera, Ruminococcaceae,
   Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, YS2
   (Cyanobacteria), and Victivallaceae are significantly associated with
   both obesity and earlier exposure to the USA, while Oscillospira and
   Anaerotruncus show paradoxical associations with both obesity and
   late-life introduction to the USA. Conclusions: Our analysis of the gut
   microbiome of Latinos demonstrates unique features that might be
   responsible for health disparities affecting Hispanics living in the
   USA.}},

Title = {{The Inhalable Mycobiome of Sawmill Workers: Exposure Characterization
   and Diversity}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Exposure to fungal spores has been associated with respiratory symptoms
   and allergic alveolitis among sawmill workers, but the complexity of
   sawmill workers' fungal exposure has been poorly studied. We
   characterized the fungal diversity in air samples from sawmill workers'
   breathing zones and identified differences in the richness, diversity,
   and taxonomic composition between companies, departments, wood types,
   and seasons. Full-shift personal inhalable dust samples (n = 86)
   collected from 11 industrial sawmill, sorting mill, and planer mill
   companies processing spruce and/or pine were subjected to DNA
   metabarcoding using the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region
   2. The workers were exposed to a higher total number of operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) in summer than in winter and when processing
   spruce than when processing pine. Workers in the saw department had the
   richest fungal exposure, followed by workers in the planing department
   and sorting of dry timber department. Sawmills explained 11\% of the
   variation in the fungal community composition of the exposure, followed
   by season (5\%) and department (3\%). The fungal compositions of the
   exposures also differed between seasons, sawmills, wood types, and
   departments at the taxonomic level, ranging from the phylum to the
   species level. The differences in exposure diversity suggest that the
   potential health effects of fungal inhalation may also be different;
   hence, a risk assessment based on the fungal diversity differences
   should be performed. This study may serve as a basis for establishing a
   fungal profile of signature species that are specific for sawmills and
   that can be measured quantitatively in future risk assessments of
   sawmill workers.
   IMPORTANCE To gain more knowledge about exposure-response relationships,
   it is important to improve exposure characterization by comprehensively
   identifying the temporal and spatial fungal composition and diversity of
   inhalable dust at workplaces. The variation in the diverse fungal
   communities to which individuals are exposed in different seasons and
   sawmills suggests that variations in exposure-related health effects
   between seasons and companies can be expected. More importantly, the
   distinct fungal profiles between departments across companies indicate
   that workers in different job groups are differently exposed and that
   health risks can be department specific. DNA metabarcoding provides
   insight into a broad spectrum of airborne fungi that may serve as a
   basis for obtaining important knowledge about the fungi to which workers
   are exposed.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Background: Firm consensus has yet to be established in relation to
   taxonomic classification and primer choice in targeted amplicon
   sequencing of the mycobiome. While the nuclear ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region are recognized as the formal fungal
   taxonomic barcode, appraisal of different ITS sub-regions and the
   influence of DNA extraction methods have not been comprehensively
   undertaken using human respiratory specimens. (2) Methods: We performed
   ITS analysis of respiratory (sputum) samples by assessing (a) the effect
   of alternate DNA extraction techniques and (b) an evaluation of four
   different ITS primer pairs (ITS1F and ITS2; ITS1-30F and ITS1-217R;
   gITS7ngs and ITS4ng; and Fseq and Rseq) on the mycobiome profiles
   generated for mock fungal communities and their respective clinical
   (airway) specimens. (3) Results: Primer pairs varied in their resulting
   ITS mycobiome profiles, suggesting that particular pairs may be more
   relevant for analysis of respiratory samples compared to others.
   Assessment of DNA extraction methods highlighted lower final DNA
   concentrations achieved by mechanical disruption compared to enzymatic
   lysis. However, despite lower yields, DNA liberated by mechanical lysis
   more readily yielded ITS bands with highest success in combination with
   the Fseq and Rseq primers. (4) Conclusion: Choice of extraction method,
   primers used, and sequencing approach are all important considerations
   in sequencing the mycobiome and should be tailored to sample type. A
   standardization of approach to mycobiome studies using respiratory
   specimens will permit more reliable comparisons between studies and
   improve our understanding of the role of fungi in the human airway.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi play a crucial role in terrestrial Arctic ecosystems as symbionts

   In this study we apply high-throughput sequencing to investigate the
   mycobiome of 172 samples of fresh (current year) and aged (3 year old)
   needles of Picea glauca from three sites over a distance of 500 km in
   Alaska (USA). We analysed Illumina-generated ITS2 sequences to relate
   mycobiome data with phenotypic tree traits, measures of genetic
   variation and climate variables obtained from long-term monitoring of
   the sites.

   harshness. Fungal communities differed in richness and taxonomic
   composition between sites, with a pronounced difference in the relative
   abundance of OTUs assigned to species of the rust genus Chrysomyxa,
   plant pathogens which seem to have been in an outbreak at two sites at
   the time of sampling.
   Beside climate parameters, needle age was the second strongest
   explanatory variable of the mycobiome composition, whereas we found no
   effect of tree genetic variation, indicating that environmental and tree
   trait specific variables mainly determined individual white spruce
   mycobiomes at Alaska's treelines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and British

Title = {{A Metabarcoding Analysis of the Mycobiome of Wheat Ears Across a
   Topographically Heterogeneous Field}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Plant associated microbial communities have recently received a lot of
   attention because thought to play a fundamental role in plant health and
   development. Focusing on cultivated crops, optimized farming practices
   must consider the role of these communities when aiming at reducing the
   impact of pathogens and increasing yields. Typical inhabitants of
   plant's phyllosphere are bacteria and microscopic fungi, some of them
   pathogenic for the plant and dangerous for the consumers, due to the
   production of toxins. In order to efficiently manage the microbiome, the
   natural drivers regulating community assembly must be clearly
   understood. In our study we investigated the within field variation of
   the phyllosphere mycobiome of wheat ears by metabarcoding of the fungal
   internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1). We selected a field
   characterized by a high topographic heterogeneity, which is reflected in
   differences in plant productivity and fitness across it. Samples were
   taken from 30 sampling points laid across the field where data-loggers
   were placed, measuring the productivity driven under canopy
   microclimate. The microclimatic conditions were tested as a source of
   potential environmental variance. Further independent spatial structures
   were tested using spatial eigenvector maps (MEMs). Results show
   considerable differences in the phyllosphere composition across the
   field. The local under canopy environmental conditions at each point
   were strong predictors of the community composition. Independent spatial
   effects given by the geographical position of the sampling points showed
   also a weaker but significant effect. Moreover we observed different
   spatial responses from different fungal phyla, with results resembling
   those described in studies done at a regional scale. This study is the
   first one to investigate the spatial variation of the phyllosphere
   mycobiome of a commercial crop within the same field. It contributes to
   the study of the epidemiology and community assembly dynamics of wheat
   phyllosphere fungi, showing how in-field community variations are the
   results of different environmental and spatial processes acting
   simultaneously. It also shows how heterogeneous fields are a smart and
   useful system to investigate the ecological mechanisms regulating plant
   microbiome composition.}},

Title = {{Antibiotics and Host-Tailored Probiotics Similarly Modulate Effects on
   the Developing Avian Microbiome, Mycobiome, and Host Gene Expression}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The microbiome is important to all animals, including poultry, playing a
   critical role in health and performance. Low-dose antibiotics have
   historically been used to modulate food production animals and their
   microbiome. Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar
   modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to
   determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a
   low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing microbiome. Over
   13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a
   low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or
   without two different probiotics (8 cage units, n = 80 per group).
   Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were
   characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized
   and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome
   sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific
   kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We
   found that development of the early-life microbiome of turkey poults was
   tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose
   antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not
   nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in
   overall microbiome composition during development compared to controls.
   Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts
   in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced
   performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that
   identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic
   combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose
   antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing
   the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches may also be
   beneficial for humans.
   IMPORTANCE Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need
   for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a
   pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance
   performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their microbiota, similar
   to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that
   a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial
   turkey gut microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters
   than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored
   probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth
   promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter
   and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating
   the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches. This work
   suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development hold promise
   for modulating the avian host and its microbiota.}},

Abstract = {{The contamination of maize with fungi and subsequent mycotoxins is a
   pivotal and long-standing safety concern in the maize industry. In this
   study, the inhibitory effects of the complex essential oils
   (cinnamaldehyde, citral, eugenol, and menthol, 3:3:2:2, v/v) on fungal
   growth and mycotoxins production in stored maize were evaluated using
   traditional plate counting, internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
   sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Complex
   essential oils (0.02\%) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total fungi
   counts and the content of aflatoxin B-1, zearalenone, and deoxynivalenol
   in stored maize during 12 months of storage, and were more effective
   than propionic acid (0.2\%). The fungal diversity of the control group
   was the highest with 113 operational taxonomic units. During storage of
   maize kernels, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Wallemia, Sarocladium, and
   Penicillium were main genera. At 0-6 months, the fungal diversity was
   high and Fusarium was predominant genus. However, at 7-11 months, the
   fungal diversity was low and Aspergillus was predominant genus. During
   the later stages of storage, the prevalence of Aspergillus in maize
   treated with essential oils was significantly lower than (p < 0.05) that
   observed in the propionic acid treated and control samples. The results
   of this study suggest that the complex essential oils may be employed
   successfully to control toxigenic fungi and subsequent contamination
   with mycotoxins in maize.}},

Abstract = {{Occupational exposure to grain dust is associated with both acute and
   chronic effects on the airways. However, the aetiology of these effects
   is not completely understood, mainly due to the complexity and variety
   of potentially causative agents to which workers are exposed during
   cereals process. In this study, we characterized the mycobiome during
   different steps of wheat processing-harvesting, grain unloading and
   straw handling-and compared it to mycobiomes of domestic
   environments-rural and urban. To do so, settled dust was collected at a
   six month interval for six weeks in the close proximity of 142
   participants, 74 occupationally exposed to wheat dust-freshly harvested
   or stored-and 68 not occupationally exposed to it. Fungal community
   composition was determined in those samples by high-throughput
   sequencing of the primary fungal barcode marker internal transcribed
   spacer 1 (ITS1). The comparison of different mycobiomes revealed that
   fungal richness, as well as their composition, was much higher in the
   domestic environment than at the workplace. Furthermore, we found that
   the fungal community composition strongly differed between workplaces
   where workers handled freshly harvested wheat and those where they
   handled stored wheat. Indicator species for each exposed population were
   identified. Our results emphasize the complexity of exposure of grain
   workers and farmers and open new perspectives in the identification of
   the etiological factors responsible for the respiratory pathologies
   induced by wheat dust exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Surfaces within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), especially
   those handled frequently by hospital staff, provide sources of
   gut-colonizing bacteria for hospitalized infants, in addition to those
   acquired perinatally from maternal sources such as breastmilk. In
   comparison to bacteria, very little is known about potential sources of
   colonizing fungi in the NICU setting. Thus, the objective of this study
   was to characterize fungal communities (mycobiomes) of potential
   colonization sources for neonates hospitalized in a large university
   NICU. We hypothesized that the unit surfaces would contain different
   mycobiomes than those of human-associated (breastmilk) sources. We
   characterized mycobiomes of NICU surfaces of multiple individual patient
   care areas as well as those of breastmilk samples by sequencing the
   internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) of the fungal rDNA locus. We
   found that, across all samples, Candida and Saccharomyces species were
   the most prevalent taxa and had the greatest relative abundances.
   Breastmilk samples had significantly higher fungal alpha-diversities
   than NICU surface samples and fungal community compositions (beta
   diversities) differed significantly between the two sample types.
   Mycobiome compositions were predominantly driven by the relative
   abundances of three fungal taxa: Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis,
   and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In total, 21 individual fungal taxa showed
   significantly greater relative abundances in breastmilk as compared to
   NICU surfaces, with three being of particular interest to human health:
   Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Since
   no fungal DNA was detected when whole breastmilk was used as the DNA
   template, as opposed to breastmilk subjected to cell lysis during the
   DNA isolation procedure, our results indicate that DNA is from fungal
   cells and is not cell-free DNA. In summary, both NICU surfaces and human
   breastmilk harbor distinct fungal communities that could provide a
   source of fungi for the developing infant gut mycobiota. In particular,
   Candida and Saccharomyces species are abundant and prevalent for both of
   these potential sources that infants are exposed to.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial ecology studies are often performed through extraction of
   metagenomic DNA followed by amplification and sequencing of a marker. It
   is known that each step may bias the results. These biases have been
   explored for the study of bacterial communities, but rarely for fungi.
   Our aim was therefore to evaluate methods for the study of the gut
   mycobiome. We first evaluated DNA extraction methods in fungal cultures
   relevant to the gut. Afterwards, to assess how these methods would
   behave with an actual sample, stool from a donor was spiked with cells
   from the same cultures. We found that different extraction kits favour
   some species and bias against others. In terms of amplicon sequencing,
   we evaluated five primer sets, two for ITS2 and one for ITS1, 185 and
   285 rRNA. Results showed that 185 rRNA outperformed the other markers:
   it was able to amplify all the species in the mock community and to
   discriminate among them. ITS primers showed both amplification and
   sequencing biases, the latter related to the variable length of the
   product. We identified several biases in the characterisation of the gut
   mycobiome and showed how crucial it is to be aware of these before
   drawing conclusions from the results of these studies.}},

Abstract = {{Gut mycobiota dysbiosis can negatively impact the outcome of several
   diseases of inflammatory origin, suggesting a role of the mycobiota in
   influencing the host immunity. However, it is unknown whether the gut
   mycobiota composition can create an immune environment that would
   influence the immune response to a newly introduced intestinal fungus.
   Using ITS1 deep sequencing, we evaluated the mycobiome structure of
   C57BL/6J mice acquired from Jackson (JAX) or bred in a controlled
   environment at a dedicated room in our own mouse facility (WCM-CE) for
   several generations. We found that C57BL/6J mice from these segregated
   mouse colonies harbor dramatically different mycobiota. To assess
   whether the mycobiota make up can influence immune responses to
   colonization with a fungus foreign to the murine GI tract, we colonized
   JAX and WCM-CE mice with the human commensal C. albicans and measured
   Th17 responses in the gut. We found that independent of mycobiota
   composition, mice produced strong Th17 responses to gastrointestinal C.
   albicans colonization. Our data suggest that different mouse colonies
   can carry dramatically different mycobiota. Nevertheless, strong Th17
   responses to a newly introduced opportunistic commensal fungus are
   potently induced independent of the mycobiota background in this
   experimental setting.}},

Abstract = {{Mucor circinelloides is a pathogenic fungus and etiologic agent of
   mucormycosis. In 2013, cases of gastrointestinal illness after yogurt
   consumption were reported to the US FDA, and the producer found that its
   products were contaminated with Mucor. A previous study found that the
   Mucor strain isolated from an open contaminated yogurt exhibited
   virulence in a murine systemic infection model and showed that this
   strain is capable of surviving passage through the gastrointestinal
   tract of mice. In this study, we isolated another Mucor strain from an
   unopened yogurt that is closely related but distinct from the first
   Mucor strain and subsequently examined if Mucor alters the gut
   microbiota in a murine host model. DNA extracted from a ten-day course
   of stool samples was used to analyze the microbiota in the
   gastrointestinal tracts of mice exposed via ingestion of Mucor spores.
   The bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 sequences obtained were used
   to identify taxa of each kingdom. Linear regressions revealed that there
   are changes in bacterial and fungal abundance in the gastrointestinal
   tracts of mice which ingested Mucor. Furthermore, we found an increased
   abundance of the bacterial genus Bacteroides and a decreased abundance
   of the bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila in the gastrointestinal tracts
   of exposed mice. Measurements of abundances show shifts in relative
   levels of multiple bacterial and fungal taxa between mouse groups. These
   findings suggest that exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to Mucor
   can alter the microbiota and, more importantly, illustrate an
   interaction between the intestinal mycobiota and bacteriota. In
   addition, Mucor was able to induce increased permeability in epithelial
   cell monolayers in vitro, which might be indicative of unstable
   intestinal barriers. Understanding how the gut microbiota is shaped is
   important to understand the basis of potential methods of treatment for
   gastrointestinal illness. How the gut microbiota changes in response to
   exposure, even by pathogens not considered to be causative agents of
   food-borne illness, may be important to how commercial food producers
   prevent and respond to contamination of products aimed at the public.
   This study provides evidence that the fungal microbiota, though
   understudied, may play an important role in diseases of the human gut.}},

Abstract = {{The yeasts transmitted from seeds to sprouts might be used as probiotics
   for host plants. To investigate the inheritable yeasts of rice plants

   analysis. The endophytic yeasts were isolated from rice sprouts by yeast
   selective medium. Compared with the negative controls, inoculation of
   isolate Y3 released 2.2 folds higher concentration of free phosphate in
   soybean meal broth. Most of the phytase activities were located in the
   yeast cell interiors. The shoot lengths, shoot fresh weights, and root
   fresh weights of inoculated seedlings increased by 35\%, 80\%, and 60\%
   compared with the control seedlings, respectively. The results suggested
   that the rice sprouts contained diverse phytase-producing yeasts

Title = {{Mycobiome Profiles in Breast Milk from Healthy Women Depend on Mode of
   Delivery, Geographic Location, and Interaction with Bacteria}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies report the presence of fungal species in breast milk of
   healthy mothers, suggesting a potential role in infant mycobiome
   development. In the present work, we aimed to determine whether the
   healthy human breast milk mycobiota is influenced by geographical
   location and mode of delivery, as well as to investigate its interaction
   with bacterial profiles in the same samples. A total of 80 mature breast
   milk samples from 4 different countries were analyzed by Illumina
   sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region, joining
   the 18S and 5.8S regions of the fungal rRNA region. Basidiomycota and
   Ascomycota were found to be the dominant phyla, with Malassezia and
   Davidiella being the most prevalent genera across countries. A core
   formed by Malassezia, Davidiella, Sistotrema, and Penicillium was shared
   in the milk samples from the different origins, although specific shifts
   in mycobiome composition were associated with geographic location and
   delivery mode. The presence of fungi in the breast milk samples was
   further confirmed by culture and isolate characterization, and fungal
   loads were estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the fungal
   ITS1 region. Cooccurrence network analysis of bacteria and fungi showed
   complex interactions that were influenced by geographical location, mode
   of delivery, maternal age, and pregestational body mass index. The
   presence of a breast milk mycobiome was confirmed in all samples
   analyzed, regardless of the geographic origin.
   IMPORTANCE During recent years, human breast milk has been documented as
   a potential source of bacteria for the newborn. Recently, we have
   reported the presence of fungi in breast milk from healthy mothers. It
   is well known that environmental and perinatal factors can affect milk
   bacteria; however, the impact on milk fungi is still unknown. The
   current report describes fungal communities (mycobiota) in breast milk
   samples across different geographic locations and the influence of the
   mode of delivery. We also provide novel insights on bacterium-fungus
   interactions, taking into account environmental and perinatal factors.
   We identified a core of four genera shared across locations, consisting
   of Malassezia, Davidiella, Sistotrema, and Penicillium, which have been
   reported to be present in the infant gut. Our data confirm the presence
   of fungi in breast milk across continents and support the potential role
   of breast milk in the initial seeding of fungal species in the infant
   gut.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by
   serologic responses to glycans. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
   after proctocolectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis (pouch surgery) may
   develop inflammation (pouchitis) that resembles Crohn's disease (CD). We
   hypothesized that patients' serologic responses were affected by their
   consumption of dietary sugars. This study analyzed the correlations
   between antiglycan antibody expression and dietary sugar consumption in
   patients with UC pouch and the evolution in antibody levels over time.
   Methods: Patients were followed prospectively for 2 consecutive visits.
   The following antiglycan carbohydrate antibodies were detected by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: antichitobioside (ACCA),
   antilaminaribioside (ALCA), antimannobioside (AMCA), and
   anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) antibodies. Patients completed a
   food frequency questionnaire. The fungal community in patients' fecal
   samples was analyzed by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer 2
   (ITS2) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA.
   Results: We included 75 UC pouch patients aged 45.2 +/- 14 years who
   underwent pouch surgery 9.8 +/- 6.7 years previously. Of these patients,
   34.7\% (n = 26) showed seropositivity for antiglycan antibodies. Starch
   consumption was significantly higher in patients with positive serologic
   responses (P = 0.05). Higher starch consumption was associated with
   higher AMCA and ACCA titers, which increased by 4.08\% (0.8\%-7.4\%; P =
   0.014) and 4.8\% (0.7\%-9.1\%; P = 0.007), respectively, for each 10-g
   increase of dietary starch. The per-patient change in the relative
   abundance of Candida albicans in fecal samples correlated positively
   with changes in starch consumption (Spearman's r = 0.72; P = 0.012).
   Conclusions: Starch consumption correlated with positive antiglycan
   serology (ACCA and AMCA), suggesting that increased dietary starch
   intake may promote a specific immune response in patients with IBD.}},

Abstract = {{The species of the genus Saccharomyces are commonly inhabiting tree bark
   and the surrounding soil, but their abundance have likely been
   underestimated due to biases in culturing methods. Metagenomic studies
   have so far been unable to detect Saccharomyces species in wild
   environments. Here, we sequenced the mycobiome of soils surrounding
   different trees at various altitudes in the Italian Alps. To survey for
   yeasts species belonging to Saccharomyces genus rather than other fungal
   species, we performed a selectivity step involving the isolation of the
   internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region that is specific to this yeast
   group. Reads mapping to Saccharomyces species were detected in all soil
   samples, including reads for S. mikatae and for S. eubayanus. ITS1
   alignment of the S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus and S. kudriavzevii
   sequences showed up to three base pair polymorphisms with other known
   strains, indicating possible new lineages. Basidiomycetous fungi were
   still the dominant species, compared to the Ascomycota, but the
   selectivity step allowed for the first time the detection and study of
   the biodiversity of the Saccharomyces species in their natural
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of fungicide treatments on non-target fungi in the phyllosphere
   are not well known. We studied community composition and dynamics of
   target (Puccinia striiformis) and non-target fungi in wheat that was
   heavily infected with yellow rust. Mycobiotas in bulk leaf samples and
   individual leaves were studied by metabarcoding targeting the internal
   transcribed spacer-1 (ITS1) region of the ribosomal DNA. The amount of
   yellow rust in individual samples was quantified by qPCR (quantitative
   PCR). In addition, septoria tritici blotch (Zymo-septoria tritici),
   powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis), tan spot (Pyrenophora
   tritici-repentis), and yellow rust (P. striiformis) were visually
   evaluated. We showed how fungal communities were affected by three
   different broad-spectrum fungicides that had been applied at different
   timings and doses to control Puccinia striiformis. We showed that fungal
   content was relatively constant even after fungicide treatments.
   Principal component analysis demonstrated that communities from
   fungicide-treated plots could be separated from the communities in
   non-treated plots. We observed effects of fungicide treatments on fungal
   communities using different dose, timing and products. Some fungi,
   including the target organism P. striiformis were effectively controlled
   by most of the fungicide applications whereas some yeasts and also P.
   tritici-repentis increased after treatments. We demonstrated the
   feasibility of using metabarcoding as a supplement to visual assessments
   of fungicide effects on target as well as non-target fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive fungal infections are an increasingly important cause of human
   morbidity and mortality. We generated a next-generation sequencing
   (NGS)-based method designed to detect a wide range of fungi and applied
   it to analysis of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) of the lung during
   fungal infection. Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicon
   sequencing and a custom analysis pipeline detected 96\% of species from
   three mock communities comprised of potential fungal lung pathogens with
   good recapitulation of the expected species distributions (Pearson
   correlation coefficients r = 0.63, p = 0.004; r = 0.71, p < 0.001; r =
   0.62, p = 0.002). We used this pipeline to analyze mycobiomes of
   bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens classified as culture-negative (n
   = 50) or culture-positive (n = 39) for Blastomyces
   dermatitidis/gilchristii, the causative agent of North America
   blastomycosis. Detected in 91.4\% of the culture-positive samples,
   Blastomyces dominated (>50\% relative abundance) the mycobiome in 68.6\%
   of these culture-positive samples but was absent in culturenegative
   samples. To overcome any bias in relative abundance due to
   between-sample variation in fungal biomass, an abundance-weighting
   calculation was used to normalize the data by accounting for
   sample-specific PCR cycle number and PCR product concentration data
   utilized during sample preparation. After normalization, there was a
   statistically significant greater overall abundance of ITS1 amplicon in
   the Blastomycesculture-positive samples versus culture-negative samples.
   Moreover, the normalization revealed a greater biomass of yeast and
   environmental fungi in several Blastomycesculture-positive samples than
   in the culture-negative samples. Successful detection of Coccidioides,
   Scedosporium, Phaeoacremonium, and Aspergillus in 6 additional
   culture-positive BALs by ITS1 amplicon sequencing demonstrates the
   ability of this method to detect a broad range of fungi from clinical
   specimens, suggesting that it may be a potentially useful adjunct to
   traditional fungal microbiological testing for the diagnosis of
   respiratory mycoses.}},

Journal = {{MSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Intestinal bacterial dysbiosis has been increasingly linked to
   ankylosing spondylitis (AS), which is a prototypic and best studied
   subtype of spondyloarthritis (SpA). Fungi and bacteria coexist in the
   human gut and interact with each other. Although they have been shown to
   contribute actively to health or disease, no studies have investigated
   whether the fungal microbiota in AS patients is perturbed. In this
   study, fecal samples from 22 AS patients, with clinical and radiographic
   assessments, and 16 healthy controls (HCs) were collected to
   systematically characterize the gut microbiota and mycobiota in AS
   patients by 16S rRNA gene- and ITS2-based DNA sequencing. Our results
   showed that the microbiota of AS patients was characterized by increased
   abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased Bacteroidetes, which was
   contributed by enrichment of Escherichia-Shigella, Veillonella, La
   NK4A136 group, and reduction of Prevotella strain 9, Megamona, and
   Fusobacterium. The gut mycobiota of AS patients was characterized by
   higher levels of Ascomycota, especially the class of Dothideomycetes,
   and decreased abundance of Basidiomycota, which was mainly contributed
   by the decease of Agaricales. Compared to HCs, decreased ITS2/16S
   biodiversity ratios and altered bacterial-fungal interkingdom networks
   were observed in AS patients. Compared with nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), treating AS patients with biological
   agents induced obvious changes in the gut mycobiota, and this result was
   highly associated with disease activity indexes, including AS disease
   activity index (ASDAS) C-reactive protein (asCRP), erythrocyte
   sedimentation rate (ESR), and Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI).
   In addition, altered mycobiota in AS patients was also found associated
   with the degree of radiographic damage.
   IMPORTANCE The human gut is colonized by diverse fungi (mycobiota), and
   fungi have long been suspected in the pathogenesis of SpA. Our study
   unraveled a disease-specific interkingdom network alteration in AS,
   suggesting that fungi, or the interkingdom interactions between bacteria
   and fungi, may play an essential role in AS development. However, our
   study is limited by sample size, and in-depth mechanism studies and
   additional large-scale investigations characterizing the gut mycobiome
   in AS patients are needed to form a foundation for research into the
   relationship between mycobiota dysbiosis and AS development.}},

Abstract = {{Children's oral health is in a dire state, with dental decay (caries)
   being one of the most common chronic diseases. While the role of
   bacteria in the oral microbiome and dental caries is established, the
   contribution of fungi is relatively unknown. We assessed the oral
   mycobiome in childhood (n = 17), to determine if the composition of
   fungi varies between children with and without caries. Oral mycobiome
   composition was assessed by using Illumina MiSeq to sequence the ITS2
   region, which was amplified from dental plaque. This revealed that the
   oral mycobiome in the investigated children contained 46 fungal species.
   Candida albicans was the most abundant species and was ubiquitous in all
   samples, indicating this species may not be involved in caries
   development as previously suggested. While the overall diversity of
   fungi was similar, independent of caries status (p > 0.05), we found
   caries influenced the abundance of specific fungi. Children without
   caries had a significantly higher abundance of 17 species compared to
   children with caries, which had three enriched species (p < 0.001).
   While the differentially abundant species between health and caries may
   be specific to an Australian population, our findings indicate the
   mycobiome plays a role in oral health.}},

Abstract = {{Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients often present
   with poor oral health, making it difficult to assess the relationship
   between oral microbes, inflammation, and carcinoma. This study
   investigates salivary microbes and inflammatory cytokines as biomarkers
   for HNSCC, with consideration of oral health. Saliva was collected from
   30 participants, including 14 HNSCC patients and 16 participants
   representing both dentally compromised and healthy individuals.
   Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed based on 16S rRNA gene
   and ITS1 amplicon sequencing, respectively, and concentrations of
   inflammatory cytokines were quantified using a cytometric bead array,
   with flow cytometry. Diversity-based analyses revealed that the
   bacterial communities of HNSCC patients were significantly different to
   those of the healthy control group but not the dentally compromised
   patients. Fungal communities were dominated by Candida, irrespective of
   cohort, with Candida albicans comprising >= 96\% of fungal sequences in
   most HNSCC patients. Significantly higher concentrations of interleukin
   (IL)-1 beta and IL-8 were detected in HNSCC and dentally compromised
   patients, when independently compared with healthy controls. IL-1 beta
   and IL-8 concentrations were significantly positively correlated with
   the abundance of C. albicans. Our findings suggest that salivary
   microbial and inflammatory biomarkers of HNSCC are influenced by oral

Abstract = {{Lichen thalli harbor complex fungal communities (mycobiomes) of species
   with divergent trophic and ecological strategies. The complexity and
   diversity of lichen mycobiomes are still largely unknown, despite
   surveys combining culture-based methods and high-throughput sequencing
   (HTS). The results of such surveys are strongly influenced by the
   barcode locus chosen, its sensitivity in discriminating taxa, and the
   depth to which public sequence repositories cover the phylogenetic
   spectrum of fungi. Here, we use HTS of the internal transcribed spacer 2
   (ITS2) to assess the taxonomic composition and diversity of a
   well-characterized, alpine rock lichen community that includes thalli
   symptomatically infected by lichenicolous fungi as well as asymptomatic
   thalli. Taxa belonging to the order Chaetothyriales are the major
   components of the observed lichen mycobiomes. We predict sequences
   representative of lichenicolous fungi characterized morphologically and
   assess their asymptomatic presence in lichen thalli. We demonstrated the
   limitations of metabarcoding in fungi and show how the estimation of
   species diversity widely differs when ITS1 or ITS2 are used as barcode,
   and particularly biases the detection of Basidiomycota. The
   complementary analysis of both ITS1 and ITS2 loci is therefore required
   to reliably estimate the diversity of lichen mycobiomes.}},

Title = {{Combined bacterial and fungal intestinal microbiota analyses: Impact of
   storage conditions and DNA extraction protocols}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The human intestinal microbiota contains a vast community of
   microorganisms increasingly studied using high-throughput DNA
   sequencing. Standardized protocols for storage and DNA extraction from
   fecal samples have been established mostly for bacterial microbiota
   analysis. Here, we investigated the impact of storage and DNA extraction
   on bacterial and fungal community structures detected concomitantly.
   Methods
   Fecal samples from healthy adults were stored at -80'C as such or
   diluted in RNAlater0 and subjected to 2 extraction protocols with
   mechanical lysis: the Powersoil (R) MoBio kit or the International Human
   Microbiota Standard (IHMS) Protocol Q. Libraries of the 12 samples
   targeting the V3-V4 16S and the ITS1 regions were prepared using
   Metabiote (R) (Genoscreen) and sequenced on GS-FLX-454. Sequencing data
   were analysed using SHAMAN (http://shaman.pasteur.fr/). The bacterial
   and fungal microbiota were compared in terms of diversity and relative
   abundance.
   Results
   We obtained 171869 and 199089 quality-controlled reads for 16S and ITS,
   respectively. All 16S reads were assigned to 41 bacterial genera; only
   52\% of ITS reads were assigned to 40 fungal genera/section. Rarefaction
   curves were satisfactory in 3/3 and 2/3 subjects for 16S and ITS,
   respectively. PCoA showed important inter-individual variability of
   intestinal microbiota largely overweighing the effect of storage or
   extraction. Storage in RNAlater (R) impacted (downward trend) the
   relative abundances of 7/41 bacterial and 6/40 fungal taxa, while
   extraction impacted randomly 18/41 bacterial taxa and 1/40 fungal taxon.
   Conclusion
   Our results showed that RNAlater (R) moderately impacts bacterial or
   fungal community structures, while extraction significantly influences
   the bacterial composition. For combined bacterial and fungal intestinal
   microbiota analysis, immediate sample freezing should be preferred when
   feasible, but storage in RNAlater (R) remains an option under
   unfavourable conditions or for concomitant metatranscriptomic analysis;
   and extraction should rely on protocols validated for bacterial
   analysis, such as IHMS Protocol Q, and including a powerful mechanical
   lysis, essential for fungal extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Deciphering of the mycobiome in pristine karst caves has been impeded by
   constraints of remote locations, inaccessibility to specimens and
   technical limitations, which greatly restricted in-depth understanding
   of mycobiomes in subterranean ecosystem. Here, mycobiomes of Heshang
   Cave in south-western karst region of China were investigated by
   Illumina HiSeq sequencing of fungal rRNA-ITS1 gene across different
   habitats. In total 793,502 ITS1 reads and 2,179 OTUs from 778 Mb reads
   after stringent quality control (030) and 453 genera, 72 orders and 19
   classes within 6 phyla were detected. Ascomycota (42\% OTUs) dominated
   across the five habitats. Shannon-Wiener index varied from 1.25 to 7.62
   and community richness was highest in drip waters, followed by weathered
   rocks, bat guanos, sediments, and air samples. Mycobiomes displayed
   specificity to five habitats and more distinct OTUs were found in
   weathered rocks (12\%) and drip waters (9\%). In contrast, only 6.60\%
   core OTUs were shared by five habitats. Notably, weathered rocks
   possessed more indicator groups and were revealed for the first time to
   be dominated by Sordariomycetes (43\%). The community richness of air
   mycobiomes increased from cave entrance to the innermost part and
   dominated by the indicator groups of Penicillium mallochii (>30\%) and
   P. herquei (> 9\%). Our work represents the largest attempt to date to a
   systematical investigation of oligotrophic solution-cave-associated
   mycobiomes in China. Our discovery of high diversity of mycobiomes in
   Heshang Cave also suggests that eukaryotic microorganisms may play a
   crucial role in subsurface environments.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the composition and clinical importance of the fungal
   mycobiome was recently identified as a key topic in a ``research
   priorities{''} consensus statement for bronchiectasis.
   Patients were recruited as part of the CAMEB study: an international
   multicentre cross-sectional Cohort of Asian and Matched European
   Bronchiectasis patients. The mycobiome was determined in 238 patients by
   targeted amplicon shotgun sequencing of the 18S-28S rRNA internally
   transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2. Specific quantitative PCR for
   detection of and conidial quantification for a range of airway
   Aspergillus species was performed. Sputum galactomannan, Aspergillus
   specific IgE, IgG and TARC (thymus and activation regulated chemokine)
   levels were measured systemically and associated to clinical outcomes.
   The bronchiectasis mycobiome is distinct and characterised by specific
   fungal genera, including Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and Clavispora.
   Aspergillus fumigatus (in Singapore/Kuala Lumpur) and Aspergillus
   terreus (in Dundee) dominated profiles, the latter associating with
   exacerbations. High frequencies of Aspergillus-associated disease
   including sensitisation and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were
   detected. Each revealed distinct mycobiome profiles, and associated with
   more severe disease, poorer pulmonary function and increased
   exacerbations.
   The pulmonary mycobiome is of clinical relevance in bronchiectasis.
   Screening for Aspergillus-associated disease should be considered even
   in apparently stable patients.}},

Abstract = {{Biochar can enhance plant growth and reduce diseases, but frequently the
   optimal doses for these two benefits do not coincide. An approach is
   needed that will extend the range of biochar doses resulting in a
   concurrence of maximum benefits for both plant productivity and disease
   suppression.
   A biochar-amended growth medium was pre-conditioned by pre-planting
   fertigation in order to enhance the indigenous microbial community
   structure and activity. Cucumber plant performance and resistance
   against damping-off caused by Pythium aphanidermatum were monitored.
   Soil microbial activity, as well as bacterial and fungal community
   structure, were assessed by high-throughput 16S rRNA and ITS1 gene
   amplicon sequencing.
   Pre-conditioning enhanced the efficacy of biochar for improving plant
   performance and suppressing soilborne disease through enriching the
   medium in beneficial soil microorganisms, increasing microbial and
   fungal diversity and activity, and eliminating biochar phytotoxic

   The pre-conditioning process brought dose-response curves for both
   growth and disease resistance into sync, resulting in maximum benefits
   for both. These findings suggest that pre-conditioning should be
   incorporated as an important stage during biochar application in soil
   and soilless media.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of next-generation sequencing and microbial community
   characterization, we are beginning to understand the key factors that
   shape early-life microbial colonization and associated health outcomes.
   Studies characterizing infant microbial colonization have focused mostly
   on bacteria in the microbiome and have largely neglected fungi (the
   mycobiome), despite their relevance to mucosal infections in healthy
   infants. In this pilot study, we characterized the skin, oral, and anal
   mycobiomes of infants over the first month of life (n = 17) and the anal
   and vaginal mycobiomes of mothers (n = 16) by internal transcribed
   spacer 2 (ITS2) amplicon sequencing. We found that infant mycobiomes
   differed by body site, with the infant mycobiomes at the anal sites
   being different from those at the skin and oral sites. The relative
   abundances of body site-specific taxa differed by birth mode, with
   significantly more Candida albicans fungi present on the skin of
   vaginally born infants on day 30 and significantly more Candida
   orthopsilosis fungi present in the oral cavity of caesarean section-born
   infants throughout the first month of life. We found the mycobiomes
   within individual infants to be variable over the first month of life,
   and vaginal birth did not result in infant mycobiomes that were more
   similar to the mother's vaginal mycobiome. Therefore, although vertical
   transmission of specific fungal isolates from mother to infant has been
   reported, it is likely that other sources (environment, other
   caregivers) also contribute to early-life mycobiome establishment. Thus,
   future longitudinal studies of mycobiome and bacterial microbiome
   codevelopment, with dense sampling from birth to beyond the first month
   of life, are warranted.
   IMPORTANCE Humans are colonized by diverse fungi (mycobiome), which have
   received much less study to date than colonizing bacteria. We know very
   little about the succession of fungal colonization in early life and
   whether it may relate to long-term health. To better understand fungal
   colonization and its sources, we studied the skin, oral, and anal
   mycobiomes of healthy term infants and the vaginal and anal mycobiomes
   of their mothers. Generally, infants were colonized by few fungal taxa,
   and fungal alpha diversity did not increase over the first month of
   life. There was no clear community maturation over the first month of
   life, regardless of body site. Key body-site-specific taxa, but not
   overall fungal community structures, were impacted by birth mode. Thus,
   additional studies to characterize mycobiome acquisition and succession
   throughout early life are needed to form a foundation for research into
   the relationship between mycobiome development and human disease.}},

Abstract = {{This study is unique as it compares traditional and high-resolution
   culture-independent approaches using the same set of samples to study
   the saprotrophic fungi on Vitis vinifera. We identified the saprotrophic
   communities of table grape (Red Globe) and wine grape (Carbanate
   Gernischet) in China using both traditional and culture-independent
   techniques. The traditional approach used direct observations based on
   morphology, single spore isolation and phylogenetic analysis yielding 45
   taxa which 19 were commonly detected in both cultivars. The same set of
   samples were then used for Illumina sequencing which analyzed ITS1
   sequence data and detected 226 fungal OTUs, of which 176 and 189 belong
   to the cultivars Carbanate Gernischet and Red Globe, respectively. There
   were 139 OTUs shared between the two V. vinifera cultivars and 37 and 50
   OTUs were specific to Carbanate Gernischet and Red Globe cultivars
   respectively. In the Carbanate Gernischet cultivar, Ascomycota accounted
   for 77\% of the OTUs and in Red Globe, almost all sequenced were
   Ascomycota. The fungal taxa overlap at the genus and species level
   between the traditional and culture-independent approach was relatively
   low. In the traditional approach we were able to identify the taxa to
   species level, while in the culture-independent method we were
   frequently able to identify the taxa to family or genus level. This is
   remarkable as we used the same set of samples collected in China for
   both approaches. We recommend the use of traditional techniques to
   accurately identify taxa. Culture-independent method can be used to get
   a better understanding about the organisms that are present in a host in
   its natural environment. We identified primary and secondary plant
   pathogens and endophytes in the saprotrophic fungal communities, which
   support previous observations, that dead plant material in grape
   vineyards can be the primary sources of disease. Finally, based on
   present and previous findings, we provide a worldwide checklist of 905
   fungal taxa on Vitis species, which includes their mode of life and
   distribution.}},

Title = {{Seagrass-associated fungal communities follow Wallace's line, but host
   genotype does not structure fungal community}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{762-770}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To test whether or not fungal communities associated with the
   widespread seagrass, Syringodium isoetifolium can be differentiated on
   either side of Wallace's line, a boundary line separating Asian and
   Australasian fauna. Additionally, we examine whether host multilocus
   genotype predicts fungal community composition.
   Location: A total of 77 samples were collected from 14 sampling sites
   spanning the Indonesian archipelago.
   Methods: We sequenced the fungal ITS1 gene using Illumia MiSeq
   technology and used a clustering-free Divisive Amplicon Denoising
   Algorithm to infer ribosomal sequence variants. Data were analysed via
   non-metric multidimensional scaling, Mantel tests and permutational
   multivariate analysis of variance. Binary and quantitative null models
   were used to determine whether results significantly deviated from
   random. Host genotype was determined by genotyping at 18 microsatellite
   loci and standard genetic analysis was performed in the R package APE.
   Results: Significant differences in fungal community composition were
   detected on either side of Wallace's line (p = <. 001 R-2 = .040). A
   significant distance decay of similarity pattern was observed between
   ribosomal sequence variants and geographical distance (p = .001 R-2 =
   .227) and several fungal ribosomal sequence variants were significantly
   associated with sampling sites found either east or west of Wallace's
   line.
   Main conclusions: Fungi are generally considered to have excellent
   dispersal potentials and marine fungi have the potential to disperse far
   and wide in an environment that has no obvious barriers to dispersal.
   Despite this assumed excellent dispersal potential, we show that fungal
   communities on either side of Wallace's line are significantly different
   from one another. We speculate that limited dispersal and differences in
   habitat type are responsible for the observed pattern. Work examining
   biogeographical patterns in marine fungi is still in its infancy and
   further research is required to fully understand marine fungal
   biogeography.}},

Title = {{Investigating Colonization of the Healthy Adult Gastrointestinal Tract
   by Fungi}},
Journal = {{MSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{A wide diversity of fungi have been detected in the human
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the potential to provide or influence
   important functions. However, many of the fungi most commonly detected
   in stool samples are also present in food or the oral cavity. Therefore,
   to recognize which gut fungi are likely to have a sustained influence on
   human health, there is a need to separate transient members of the GI
   tract from true colonizers. To identify colonizing fungi, the eukaryotic
   rRNA operon's second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) was sequenced
   from the stool, saliva, and food of healthy adults following consumption
   of different controlled diets. Unlike most bacterial 16S rRNA genes, the
   only fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in stool
   DNA across multiple diets were also present in saliva and/or food.
   Additional analyses, including culture-based approaches and sequencing
   of the 18S rRNA gene, ITS2 cDNA, and DNA extracted using alternative
   methods, failed to detect additional fungi. Two abundant fungi,
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, were examined further in
   healthy volunteers. Saccharomyces became undetectable in stool when a S.
   cerevisiae-free diet was consumed, and the levels of C. albicans in
   stool were dramatically reduced by more frequent cleaning of teeth.
   Extremely low fungal abundance, the inability of fungi to grow under
   conditions mimicking the distal gut, and evidence from analysis of other
   public datasets further support the hypothesis that fungi do not
   routinely colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults.
   IMPORTANCE We sought to identify the fungi that colonize healthy GI
   tracts and that have a sustained influence on the diverse functions of
   the gut microbiome. Instead, we found that all fungi in the stool of
   healthy volunteers could be explained by their presence in oral and
   dietary sources and that our results, together with those from other
   analyses, support the model that there is little or no gastrointestinal
   colonization by fungi. This may be due to Westernization, primate
   evolution, fungal ecology, and/or the strong defenses of a healthy
   immune system. Importantly, fungal colonization of the GI tract may
   often be indicative of disease. As fungi can cause serious infections in
   immunocompromised individuals and are found at increased abundance in
   multiple disorders of the GI tract, understanding normal fungal
   colonization is essential for proper treatment and prevention of fungal
   pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Given the complexity of the airway microbiota in the respiratory tract
   of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, it seems crucial to compile the most
   exhaustive and exact list of the microbial communities inhabiting CF
   airways. The aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial and
   fungal diversity of sputa from adult CF patients during non-exacerbation
   period by culture-based and molecular methods, and ultra-deep-sequencing
   (UDS). Sputum samples from four CF patients were cultured and analysed
   by DNA extractions followed by terminal restriction fragment length
   polymorphism analysis through resolution of bacterial ribosomal gene
   (rDNA) fragments, and cloning plus sequencing of part of fungal rRNA
   genes. These approaches were compared with UDS method targeting 16S rDNA
   gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 region of rDNA. A total
   of 27 bacterial and 18 fungal genera were detected from the four
   patients. Five (18\%) and 3 (16\%) genera were detected by culture for
   bacteria and fungi, respectively, 9 (33\%) and 3 (16\%) by first
   generation sequencing (FGS) methods, and 26 (96\%) and 18 (100\%) by
   UDS. The mean number of genera detected by UDS per patient was
   statistically higher than by culture or FGS methods. Patients with
   severe airway disease as assessed by standard spirometry exhibited a
   reduced fungal and bacterial diversity. UDS approach evaluates more
   extensively the diversity of fungal and bacterial flora compared with
   cultures. However, it currently remains difficult to routinely use UDS
   mainly because of the lack of standardization, and the current cost of
   this method.}},

Title = {{CONSTAX: a tool for improved taxonomic resolution of environmental
   fungal ITS sequences}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of the most crucial steps in high-throughput
   sequence-based microbiome studies is the taxonomic assignment of
   sequences belonging to operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Without
   taxonomic classification, functional and biological information of
   microbial communities cannot be inferred or interpreted. The internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA is the conventional
   marker region for fungal community studies. While bioinformatics
   pipelines that cluster reads into OTUs have received much attention in
   the literature, less attention has been given to the taxonomic
   classification of these sequences, upon which biological inference is
   dependent.
   Results: Here we compare how three common fungal OTU taxonomic
   assignment tools (RDP Classifier, UTAX, and SINTAX) handle ITS fungal
   sequence data. The classification power, defined as the proportion of
   assigned OTUs at a given taxonomic rank, varied among the classifiers.
   Classifiers were generally consistent (assignment of the same taxonomy
   to a given OTU) across datasets and ranks; a small number of OTUs were
   assigned unique classifications across programs. We developed CONSTAX
   (CONSensus TAXonomy), a Python tool that compares taxonomic
   classifications of the three programs and merges them into an improved
   consensus taxonomy. This tool also produces summary classification
   outputs that are useful for downstream analyses.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that independent taxonomy
   assignment tools classify unique members of the fungal community, and
   greater classification power is realized by generating consensus
   taxonomy of available classifiers with CONSTAX.}},

Title = {{The gut mycobiome of the Human Microbiome Project healthy cohort}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most studies describing the human gut microbiome in healthy
   and diseased states have emphasized the bacterial component, but the
   fungal microbiome (i.e., the mycobiome) is beginning to gain recognition
   as a fundamental part of our microbiome. To date, human gut mycobiome
   studies have primarily been disease centric or in small cohorts of
   healthy individuals. To contribute to existing knowledge of the human
   mycobiome, we investigated the gut mycobiome of the Human Microbiome
   Project (HMP) cohort by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2
   (ITS2) region as well as the 18S rRNA gene.
   Results: Three hundred seventeen HMP stool samples were analyzed by ITS2
   sequencing. Fecal fungal diversity was significantly lower in comparison
   to bacterial diversity. Yeast dominated the samples, comprising eight of
   the top 15 most abundant genera. Specifically, fungal communities were
   characterized by a high prevalence of Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and
   Candida, with S. cerevisiae, M. restricta, and C. albicans operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) present in 96. 8, 88.3, and 80.8\% of samples,
   respectively. There was a high degree of inter-and intra-volunteer
   variability in fungal communities. However, S. cerevisiae, M. restricta,
   and C. albicans OTUs were found in 92.2, 78.3, and 63.6\% of volunteers,
   respectively, in all samples donated over an approximately 1-year
   period. Metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data agreed with ITS2
   results; however, ITS2 sequencing provided greater resolution of the
   relatively low abundance mycobiome constituents.
   Conclusions: Compared to bacterial communities, the human gut mycobiome
   is low in diversity and dominated by yeast including Saccharomyces,
   Malassezia, and Candida. Both inter-and intra-volunteer variability in
   the HMP cohort were high, revealing that unlike bacterial communities,
   an individual's mycobiome is no more similar to itself over time than to
   another person's. Nonetheless, several fungal species persisted across a
   majority of samples, evidence that a core gut mycobiome may exist. ITS2
   sequencing data provided greater resolution of the mycobiome membership
   compared to metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data, suggesting
   that it is a more sensitive method for studying the mycobiome of stool
   samples.}},

   in the Murine Gut}},
Journal = {{MSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Dietary fat intake and shifts in gut bacterial community composition are
   associated with the development of obesity. To date, characterization of
   microbiota in lean versus obese subjects has been dominated by studies
   of gut bacteria. Fungi, recently shown to affect gut inflammation, have
   received little study for their role in obesity. We sought to determine
   the effects of high-fat diet on fungal and bacterial community
   structures in a mouse model using the internal transcribed spacer region
   2 (ITS2) of fungal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the 16S rRNA genes of
   bacteria. Mice fed a high-fat diet had significantly different
   abundances of 19 bacterial and 6 fungal taxa than did mice fed standard
   chow, with high-fat diet causing similar magnitudes of change in overall
   fungal and bacterial microbiome structures. We observed strong and
   complex diet-specific coabundance relationships between intra-and
   interkingdom microbial pairs and dramatic reductions in the number of
   coabundance correlations in mice fed a high-fat diet compared to those
   fed standard chow. Furthermore, predicted microbiome functional modules
   related to metabolism were significantly less abundant in
   high-fat-diet-fed than in standard-chow-fed mice. These results suggest
   a role for fungi and interkingdom interactions in the association
   between gut microbiomes and obesity.
   IMPORTANCE Recent research shows that gut microbes are involved in the
   development of obesity, a growing health problem in developed countries
   that is linked to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However,
   studies showing links between microbes and metabolism have been limited
   to the analysis of bacteria and have ignored the potential contribution
   of fungi in metabolic health. This study provides evidence that
   ingestion of a high-fat diet is associated with changes to the fungal
   (and bacterial) microbiome in a mouse model. In addition, we find that
   interkingdom structural and functional relationships exist between fungi
   and bacteria within the gut and that these are perturbed by high-fat
   diet.}},

Abstract = {{As self-supporting and long-living symbiotic structures, lichens provide
   a habitat for many other organisms beside the traditionally considered
   lichen symbionts - the myco- and the photobionts. The lichen-inhabiting
   fungi either develop diagnostic phenotypes or occur asymptomatically.
   Because the degree of specificity towards the lichen host is poorly
   known, we studied the diversity of these fungi among neighbouring
   lichens on rocks in an alpine habitat. Using a sequencing metabarcoding
   approach, we show that lichen mycobiomes clearly reflect the overlap of
   multiple ecological sets of taxa, which differ in their trophic
   association with lichen thalli. The lack of specificity to the lichen
   mycobiome is further supported by the lack of community structure
   observed using clustering and ordination methods. The communities
   encountered across samples largely result from the subsampling of a
   shared species pool, in which we identify three major ecological
   components: (i) a generalist environmental pool, (ii) a
   lichenicolous/endolichenic pool and (iii) a pool of transient species.
   These taxa majorly belong to the fungal classes Dothideomycetes,
   Eurotiomycetes and Tremellomycetes with close relatives in adjacent
   ecological niches. We found no significant evidence that the
   phenotypically recognized lichenicolous fungi influence the occurrence
   of the other asymptomatic fungi in the host thalli. We claim that
   lichens work as suboptimal habitats or as a complex spore and mycelium
   bank, which modulate and allow the regeneration of local fungal
   communities. By performing an approach that minimizes ambiguities in the
   taxonomic assignments of fungi, we present how lichen mycobiomes are
   also suitable targets for improving bioinformatic analyses of fungal
   metabarcoding.}},

Abstract = {{The phyllosphere is an important habitat for a diverse microbiome and an
   important entry point for many pathogens. Factors that shape the
   phyllosphere microbiome and also the co-existence among members and how
   they affect disease development are largely understudied. In this study
   we examined the wheat mycobiome by using metabarcoding of the fungal
   ITS1 region. Leaf samples were taken from four cultivars grown at two
   locations in Denmark. Samples were taken from the three uppermost leaves
   and at three growth stages to better understand spatiotemporal variation
   of the mycobiome. Analysis of read abundances showed that geographical
   location had a major effect in shaping the mycobiome in the total
   dataset, but also leaf position, growth stage and cultivar were
   important drivers of fungal communities. Cultivar was most important in
   explaining variation in older leaves whereas location better explained
   the variation in younger leaves, suggesting that communities are shaped
   over time by the leaf environment. Network analysis revealed negative
   co-existence between Zymoseptoria tritici and the yeasts Sporobolomyces,
   Dioszegia, and Cystofilobasidiaceae. The relative abundance of Z.
   tritici and the yeasts was relatively constant between individual
   samples, suggesting that fast growing fungi rapidly occupy empty space

   A total of 338 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 28 ITS1
   OTUs, and 24 ITS2 OTUs were identified. Candida and Malassezia were the
   most frequently identified fungi. No differences could be found between
   the bacteriome and mycobiome profiles of the apical and coronal root
   segments. The bacteriome of fungi-positive root segments contained more
   Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, four different Lactobacillus OTUs,
   Propionibacterium, and Streptococcus. A Spearman correlation matrix
   between bacteriomes and mycobiomes identified no correlations, but
   separate clusters could be observed.
   A considerable proportion of the root canal infections contain fungi,
   although fungal diversity is limited. However, when fungi are present,
   the composition of the bacteriome is clearly different.
   Interaction between bacteria and fungi in root canal infections may
   complicate the infection and require alternative treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The deadwood mycobiome, also known as wood-inhabiting fungi (WIF), are
   among the key players in wood decomposition, having a large impact on
   nutrient cycling in forest soils. However, our knowledge of WIF richness
   and distribution patterns in different forest biomes is limited. Here,
   we used pyrotag sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer
   (ITS2) region to characterize the deadwood mycobiome of two tree species
   with greatly different wood characteristics (Schima superba and Pinus
   massoniana) in a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. Specifically, we
   tested (i) the effects of tree species and wood quality properties on
   WIF OTU richness and community composition; (ii) the role of biotic and
   abiotic factors in shaping the WIF communities; and (iii) the
   relationship between WIF OTU richness, community composition and
   decomposition rates. Due to different wood chemical properties, we
   hypothesized that the WIF communities derived from the two tree species
   would be correlated differently with biotic and abiotic factors. Our
   results show that deadwood in subtropical forests harbors diverse fungal
   communities comprising six ecological functional groups. We found
   interesting colonization patterns for this subtropical biome, where
   Resinicium spp. were highly detected in both broadleaved and coniferous
   deadwood. In addition, the members of Xylariales were frequently found
   in Schima. The two deadwood species differed significantly in WIF OTU
   richness (Pinus > Schima) and community composition (P < 0.001).
   Variations in WIF community composition of both tree species were
   significantly explained by wood pH and ecological factors (biotic:
   deadwood species, basal area and abiotic: soil pH), but the WIF
   communities derived from each tree species correlated differently with
   abiotic factors. Interestingly, we found that deadwood decomposition
   rate significantly correlated with WIF communities and negatively
   correlated with WIF OTU richness. We conclude that the pattern of WIF
   OTU richness and community composition are controlled by multiple
   interacting biotic and abiotic factors. Overall, our study provides an
   in-depth picture of the deadwood mycobiome in this subtropical forest.
   Furthermore, by comparing our results to results from temperate and
   boreal forests we contribute to a better understanding of patterns of
   WIF communities across different biomes and geographic locations.}},

   Japanese Individuals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The study of mycobiota remains relatively unexplored due to the lack of
   sufficient available reference strains and databases compared to those
   of bacterial microbiome studies. Deep sequencing of Internal Transcribed
   Spacer (ITS) regions is the de facto standard for fungal diversity
   analysis. However, results are often biased because of the wide variety
   of sequence lengths in the ITS regions and the complexity of
   high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. In this study, a curated
   ITS database, ntF-ITS1, was constructed. This database can be utilized
   for the taxonomic assignment of fungal community members. We evaluated
   the efficacy of strategies for mycobiome analysis by using this database
   and characterizing a mock fungal community consisting of 26 species
   representing 15 genera using ITS1 sequencing with three HTS platforms:
   Illumina MiSeq (MiSeq), Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (IonPGM),
   and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). Our evaluation demonstrated that
   PacBio's circular consensus sequencing with greater than 8 full-passes
   most accurately reconstructed the composition of the mock community.
   Using this strategy for deep-sequencing analysis of the gut mycobiota in
   healthy Japanese individuals revealed two major mycobiota types: a
   single-species type composed of Candida albicans or Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae and a multi-species type. In this study, we proposed the best
   possible processing strategies for the three sequencing platforms, of
   which, the PacBio platform allowed for the most accurate estimation of
   the fungal community. The database and methodology described here
   provide critical tools for the emerging field of mycobiome studies.}},

Abstract = {{A targeted amplicon-based metagenomics approach (metabarcoding) provides
   detailed access to the diversity of the mycobiome in any substrate in
   distinct environments on Earth. Fungi are the main decomposers of
   lignocellulosic woody debris in terrestrial forested ecosystems,
   contributing significantly to the global carbon cycle. The main
   objectives of this study were to assess the fungal taxonomic diversity
   in fallen woody debris samples from two Neotropical forest fragments
   (rainforest and seasonal forest), to analyze the qualitative and
   quantitative components of the taxonomic diversity, and to investigate
   the functional diversity of the ecological groups detected. Our study
   comprised three main methodological steps: (i) sampling in the field;
   (ii) extraction of DNA, amplification of targeted segments and massively
   parallel sequencing; and (iii) data analysis and interpretation. A total
   of 110 molecular operational taxonomic units showing sequence similarity
   of 95\% or more across the two collection sites using two DNA
   metabarcoding markers (ITS1 and ITS2) were assigned to putative fungal
   genera in 59 families, 27 orders, and 3 phyla. The number of putative
   fungal genera and the relative abundance of reads for each genus are
   higher in the tropical rainforest site than in the tropical seasonal
   forest site. Most of the identified genera are ligninolytic and
   cellulolytic and/or hemicellulolytic Basidiomycota (Agaricomycetes) and
   Ascomycota (Sordariomycetes), but ``sugar fungi{''} and fungi associated
   with plants and detritivorous insects were also detected. This is the
   first study using NGS as a rapid and large-scale useful strategy to
   uncover the diversity of wood-decaying fungi in tropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{High biodiversity is regarded as a barrier against biological invasions.
   We hypothesized that the invasion success of the pathogenic ascomycete
   Hymenoscyphus fraxineus threatening common ash in Europe relates to
   differences in dispersal and colonization success between the invader
   and the diverse native competitors. Ash leaf mycobiome was monitored by
   high-throughput sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer
   region (ITS) and quantitative PCR profiling of H.fraxineus DNA.
   Initiation of ascospore production by H.fraxineus after overwintering
   was followed by pathogen accumulation in asymptomatic leaves. The
   induction of necrotic leaf lesions coincided with escalation of
   H.fraxineus DNA levels and changes in proportion of biotrophs, followed
   by an increase of ubiquitous endophytes with pathogenic
   potential.H.fraxineus uses high propagule pressure to establish in
   leaves as quiescent thalli that switch to pathogenic mode once these
   thalli reach a certain threshold - the massive feedback from the
   saprophytic phase enables this fungus to challenge host defenses and the
   resident competitors in mid-season when their density in host tissues is
   still low. Despite the general correspondence between the ITS-1 and
   ITS-2 datasets, marker biases were observed, which suggests that
   multiple barcodes provide better overall representation of mycobiomes.}},

Abstract = {{Research on oral fungi has centered on Candida. However, recent internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS)-based studies revealed a vast number of fungal
   taxa as potential oral residents. We review DNA-based studies of the
   oral mycobiome and contrast them with cultivation-based surveys, showing
   that most genera encountered by cultivation have also been detected
   molecularly. Some taxa such as Malassezia, however, appear in high
   prevalence and abundance in molecular studies but have not been
   cultivated. Important technical and bioinformatic challenges to
   ITS-based oral mycobiome studies are discussed. These include
   optimization of sample lysis, variability in length of ITS amplicons,
   high intra-species ITS sequence variability, high inter-species
   variability in ITS copy number and challenges in nomenclature and
   maintenance of curated reference databases. Molecular surveys are
   powerful first steps to characterize the oral mycobiome but further
   research is needed to unravel which fungi detected by DNA are true oral
   residents and what role they play in oral homeostasis.}},

Title = {{Redefining the Chronic-Wound Microbiome: Fungal Communities Are
   Prevalent, Dynamic, and Associated with Delayed Healing}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Chronic nonhealing wounds have been heralded as a silent epidemic,
   causing significant morbidity and mortality especially in elderly,
   diabetic, and obese populations. Polymicrobial biofilms in the wound bed
   are hypothesized to disrupt the highly coordinated and sequential events
   of cutaneous healing. Both culture-dependent and -independent studies of
   the chronic-wound microbiome have almost exclusively focused on
   bacteria, omitting what we hypothesize are important fungal
   contributions to impaired healing and the development of complications.
   Here we show for the first time that fungal communities (the mycobiome)
   in chronic wounds are predictive of healing time, associated with poor
   outcomes, and form mixed fungal-bacterial biofilms. We longitudinally
   profiled 100, nonhealing diabetic-foot ulcers with high-throughput
   sequencing of the pan-fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) locus,
   estimating that up to 80\% of wounds contain fungi, whereas cultures
   performed in parallel captured only 5\% of colonized wounds. The
   ``mycobiome{''} was highly heterogeneous over time and between subjects.
   Fungal diversity increased with antibiotic administration and onset of a
   clinical complication. The proportions of the phylum Ascomycota were
   significantly greater (P = 0.015) at the beginning of the study in
   wounds that took >8 weeks to heal. Wound necrosis was distinctly
   associated with pathogenic fungal species, while taxa identified as
   allergenic filamentous fungi were associated with low levels of systemic
   inflammation. Directed culturing of wounds stably colonized by pathogens
   revealed that interkingdom biofilms formed between yeasts and coisolated
   bacteria. Combined, our analyses provide enhanced resolution of the
   mycobiome during impaired wound healing, its role in chronic disease,
   and impact on clinical outcomes.
   IMPORTANCE Wounds are an underappreciated but serious complication for a
   diverse spectrum of diseases. High-risk groups, such as persons with
   diabetes, have a 25\% lifetime risk of developing a wound that can
   become chronic. The majority of microbiome research related to chronic
   wounds is focused on bacteria, but the association of fungi with
   clinical outcomes remains to be elucidated. Here we describe the dynamic
   fungal communities in 100 diabetic patients with foot ulcers. We found
   that communities are unstable over time, but at the first clinical
   presentation, the relative proportions of different phyla predict
   healing times. Pathogenic fungi not identified by culture reside in
   necrotic wounds and are associated with a poor prognosis. In wounds
   stably colonized by fungi, we identified yeasts capable of forming
   biofilms in concert with bacteria. Our findings illuminate the
   associations of the fungal mycobiome with wound prognosis and healing.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-associated mycobiomes in extreme habitats are understudied and

   the needle mycobiome of white spruce (Picea glauca) at the northern
   treeline in Alaska (USA). Sequences were obtained from the same DNA that
   was used for tree genotyping. In the present study, fungal metabarcoding
   and tree microsatellite data were compared for the first time. In
   general, neighbouring trees shared more fungal taxa with each other than
   trees growing in further distance. Mycobiomes correlated strongly with
   phenological host traits and local habitat characteristics contrasting a
   dense forest stand with an open treeline site. Genetic similarity
   between trees did not influence fungal composition and no significant
   correlation existed between needle mycobiome and tree genotype. Our
   results suggest the pronounced influence of local habitat conditions and
   phenotypic tree traits on needle-inhabiting fungi. By contrast, the tree
   genetic identity cannot be benchmarked as a dominant driver for
   needle-inhabiting mycobiomes, at least not for white spruce in this

Title = {{Skin fungal community and its correlation with bacterial community of
   urban Chinese individuals}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-throughput sequencing has led to increased insights
   into the human skin microbiome. Currently, the majority of skin
   microbiome investigations are limited to characterizing prokaryotic
   communities, and our understanding of the skin fungal community
   (mycobiome) is limited, more so for cohorts outside of the western
   hemisphere. Here, the skin mycobiome across healthy Chinese individuals
   in Hong Kong are characterized.
   Results: Based on a curated fungal reference database designed for skin
   mycobiome analyses, previously documented common skin colonizers are
   also abundant and prevalent in this cohort. However, genera associated
   with local terrains, food, and medicine are also detected. Fungal
   community composition shows interpersonal (Bray-Curtis ANOSIM = 0. 398)
   and household (Bray-Curtis ANOSIM = 0.134) clustering. Roles of gender
   and age on diversity analyses are test-and site-specific, and, contrary
   to bacteria, the effect of household on fungal community composition
   dissimilarity between samples is insignificant. Site-specific,
   cross-domain positive and negative correlations at both community and
   operational taxonomic unit levels may uncover potential relationships
   between fungi and bacteria on skin.
   Conclusions: The studied Chinese population presents similar major
   fungal skin colonizers that are also common in western populations, but
   local outdoor environments and lifestyles may also contribute to
   mycobiomes of specific cohorts. Cohabitation plays an insignificant role
   in shaping mycobiome differences between individuals in this cohort.
   Increased understanding of fungal communities of non-western cohorts
   will contribute to understanding the size of the global skin
   pan-mycobiome, which will ultimately help understand relationships
   between environmental exposures, microbial populations, and the health
   of global humans.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing was used to characterize
   the peanut mycobiome during 90 days storage at five conditions. The
   fungal diversity in in-shell peanuts was higher with 110 operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) and 41 genera than peanut kernels (91 OTUs and 37
   genera). This means that the micro-environment in shell is more suitable
   for maintaining fungal diversity. At 20-30 d, Rhizopus, Eurotium and
   Wallemia were predominant in in-shell peanuts. In peanut kernels,
   Rhizopus (>30\%) and Eurotium (>20\%) were predominant at 10-20 d and 30
   d, respectively. The relative abundances of Rhizopus, Eurotium and
   Wallemia were higher than Aspergillus, because they were xerophilic and
   grew well on substrates with low water activity (a(w)). During growth,
   they released metabolic water, thereby favoring the growth of
   Aspergillus. Therefore, from 30 to 90 d, the relative abundance of
   Aspergillus increased while that of Rhizopus, Eurotium and Wallemia
   decreased. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) revealed that peanuts
   stored for 60-90 days and for 10-30 days clustered differently from each
   other. Due to low a(w\textbackslash{}) values (0.34-0.72) and low levels
   of A. flavus, nine of 51 samples were contaminated with aflatoxins.}},

   In the present study, we analysed Illumina-generated fungal ITS1

   habitats at two different altitudes in the German Alps and from a
   managed tree nursery in northern Germany. In general, leaf-inhabiting
   mycobiome diversity and composition correlated significantly with the
   origin of the trees. Under natural condition the mycobiome was more
   diverse at lower than at higher elevation, whereas fungal diversity was
   lowest in the artificial habitat of the tree nursery. We further
   identified significant correlation of leaf chlorophylls and flavonoids
   with both habitat parameters and mycobiome biodiversity. The present
   results clearly point towards a pronounced importance of local stand

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{222}},

Month = {{APR 2}},
Abstract = {{Under normal conditions, wheat is colonized by a multitude of fungi that
   can have beneficial or adverse effects on plant growth and yield. To
   study the effect of spraying wheat heads with fungicides on the fungal
   community from emergence to harvest we applied an amplicon sequencing
   approach on single wheat heads. The climatic data showed that the spring
   of 2014 was very dry and without precipitation in the two weeks around
   flowering. An initial quantitative PCR showed that the total amount of
   fungal DNA increased during the entire period, without significant
   difference between sprayed and control wheat heads. Amplicon sequencing
   of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region showed that
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified as Sporobolomyces roseus
   dominated in the first weeks, whereas Alternaria infectoria OTUs
   dominated in the last weeks before harvest. The only observed
   significant difference was that the control wheat heads contained more
   of the powdery mildew causing Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici OTUs
   compared with the sprayed wheat heads. The dry conditions around
   flowering most likely also had an effect on Fusarium head blight
   infection as Fusarium OTUs were only sporadically encountered.
   Analyses of secondary metabolites produced by Fusarium and Alternaria in
   the wheat heads confirmed the observations from the amplicon sequencing.
   Enniatin B was the most frequent contaminant present in four sprayed
   (49-538 ng/g) and three control (56-355 ng/g) wheat heads. The A.
   infectoria secondary metabolites infectopyrone and 4Z-infectopyrone were
   however consistently observed in all samples collected the last five
   weeks before harvest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular identification of fungal taxa commonly transmitted through
   seeds of sorghum in Western Africa is lacking. In the present study,
   farm-saved seeds, collected from four villages in Northern Burkina Faso,
   were surface sterilized and the distribution of fungal DNA in seeds and
   seven-day-old seedlings was analyzed by 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
   amplicon sequencing. More than 99\% of the fungal rDNA was found to
   originate from ascomycetes. The distribution of ascomycetes at species
   level was subsequently analyzed by barcoding of ITS2 rDNA. Eighteen
   Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified from seedlings,
   compared to 29 OTUs from seeds. The top-eight most abundant ascomycete
   OTUs from seedlings were annotated as: Epicoccum sorghinum, Fusarium
   thapsinum, four different Curvuloria spp., Exserohilum rostratum and
   Alternaria longissima. These OTUs were also present in amplicons from
   seed samples collected in Central Burkina Faso confirming a common
   occurrence. E. sorghinum was highly predominant in seedlings both
   measured by DNA analysis and by isolation. The dominance of E. sorghinum
   was particularly strong in roots from poorly growing seedlings.
   Pathogenicity of E. sorghinum isolates was compared to F. thapsinum by
   inoculation to seeds in vitro. Both fungal species caused significant
   inhibition of seedling growth (P < 0.001) and Koch's postulates were
   fulfilled. Extensive, dark necrosis in roots was a typical symptom of E.
   sorghinum, whereas wilting of leaves was caused primarily by F.
   thapsinum. This study provides the first molecular approach to
   characterize the seedling mycoflora of sorghum in Western Africa and
   suggests E. sorghinum as a common root pathogen. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The contamination of peanuts with Aspergillus sp. and subsequently
   aflatoxins is considered to be one of the most serious safety problems
   in the world. Mycobiome in peanuts is critical for aflatoxin production
   and food safety. To evaluate the biodiversity and ecological
   characteristics of whole communities in stored peanuts, the barcoded
   Illumina paired-end sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2
   (ITS2) region of rDNA was used to characterize the peanut mycobiome
   monthly over a period of 1 year at four main peanut grown areas, i.e.,
   Liaoning (LN, North East), Shandong (SD, East), Hubei (HB, Central), and
   Guangdong (GD, South) provinces. The fungal diversity of peanuts stored
   in SD was the highest with 98 OTUs and 43 genera, followed by LN, HB and
   GD. In peanuts stored in SD, Rhizopus, Emericella, and Clonostachys were
   predominant. In peanuts from LN, Penicillium, Eurotium, and Clonostachys
   were abundant. In peanuts from HB, Penicillium, Eurotium, and
   Aspergillus were higher. In GD peanuts, Eurotium, Aspergillus, and
   Emericella were mainly seen. The abundances of Aspergillus in LN, SD,
   HB, and GD were 0.53, 6.29, 10.86, and 25.75\%, respectively. From the
   North of China to the South, that increased over the latitude,
   suggesting that the higher temperature and relative humidity might
   increase the risk of peanuts contaminated with Aspergillus and
   aflatoxins. During the storage, Aspergillus levels were higher at 7-12
   months than in 0-6 months, suggesting that the risk increases over
   storage time. At 7-10 months, AFB(1) was higher in four areas, while
   declined further. The reduction of AFB(1) might be attributed to the
   inhibition and degradation of AFB(1) by Aspergillus niger or to the
   combination with the compounds of peanuts. This is the first study that
   identified the mycobiome and its variation in stored peanuts using ITS2
   sequencing technology, and provides the basis for a detailed
   characterization of whole mycobiome in peanuts.}},

Abstract = {{Massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) of bacterial 16S rDNA has been
   widely used to characterize the microbial makeup of the human and mouse
   gastrointestinal tract However, techniques for fungal microbiota
   (mycobiota) profiling remain relatively under-developed. Compared to 16S
   profiling, the size and sequence context of the fungal Internal
   Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1), the most common target for mycobiota
   profiling, are highly variable. Using representative gastrointestinal
   tract fungi to build a known ``mock{''} library, we examine how this
   sequence variability affects data quality derived from Illumina Miseq
   and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing pipelines. Also, while analysis of
   bacterial 16S profiles is facilitated by the presence of high-quality
   well-accepted databases of bacterial 16S sequences, such an accepted
   database has not yet emerged to facilitate fungal ITS sequence
   characterization, and we observe that redundant and inconsistent ITS1
   sequence representation in publically available fungal reference
   databases affect quantitation and annotation of species in the gut. To
   address this problem, we have constructed a manually curated reference
   database optimized for annotation of gastrointestinal fungi. This
   targeted host-associated fungi (THF) database contains 1817 ITS1
   sequences representing sequence diversity in genera previously
   identified in human and mouse gut We observe that this database
   consistently outperforms three common ITS database alternatives on
   comprehensiveness, taxonomy assignment accuracy and computational
   efficiency in analyzing sequencing data from the mouse gastrointestinal

Title = {{Characterization and quantification of the fungal microbiome in serial
   samples from individuals with cystic fibrosis}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human-associated microbial communities include fungi, but we
   understand little about which fungal species are present, their relative
   and absolute abundances, and how antimicrobial therapy impacts fungal
   communities. The disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often involves chronic
   airway colonization by bacteria and fungi, and these infections cause
   irreversible lung damage. Fungi are detected more frequently in CF
   sputum samples upon initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and several
   studies have implicated the detection of fungi in sputum with worse
   outcomes. Thus, a more complete understanding of fungi in CF is
   required.
   Results: We characterized the fungi and bacteria in expectorated sputa
   from six CF subjects. Samples were collected upon admission for systemic
   antibacterial therapy and upon the completion of treatment and analyzed
   using a pyrosequencing-based analysis of fungal internal transcribed
   spacer 1 (ITS1) and bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. A mixture of Candida
   species and Malassezia dominated the mycobiome in all samples (74\%-99\%
   of fungal reads). There was not a striking trend correlating fungal and
   bacterial richness, and richness showed a decline after antibiotic
   therapy particularly for the bacteria. The fungal communities within a
   sputum sample resembled other samples from that subject despite the
   aggressive antibacterial therapy. Quantitative PCR analysis of fungal
   18S rDNA sequences to assess fungal burden showed variation in fungal
   density in sputum before and after antibacterial therapy but no
   consistent directional trend. Analysis of Candida ITS1 sequences
   amplified from sputum or pure culture-derived genomic DNA from
   individual Candida species found little (<0.5\%) or no variation in ITS1
   sequences within or between strains, thereby validating this locus for
   the purpose of Candida species identification. We also report the
   enhancement of the publically available Visualization and Analysis of
   Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) tool for the analysis of fungal
   communities in clinical samples.
   Conclusions: Fungi are present in CF respiratory sputum. In CF, the use
   of intravenous antibiotic therapy often does not profoundly impact
   bacterial community structure, and we observed a similar stability in
   fungal species composition. Further studies are required to predict the
   effects of antibacterials on fungal burden in CF and fungal community
   stability in non-CF populations.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi are a large, complex group, increasingly recognized as emerging
   threats. Their roles as modifiers of health mandate accurate portrayals
   of fungal communities in humans. As an entry point into the airways and
   gastrointestinal tract, fungi in the mouth are relevant to several
   biocompartments. We have revised current practices in sequence-based
   taxonomy assignments and employed the improvements to address the
   question of the fungal genera present in the healthy human mouth. The
   human oral mycobiome was surveyed using massively parallel, high
   throughput sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicons
   from saliva following robust extraction methods. Taxonomy was assigned
   by comparison to a curated reference dataset, followed by filtering with
   an empirically determined BLAST E-value match statistic (10(-42)).
   Nomenclature corrections further refined results by conjoining redundant
   names for a single fungal genus. Following these curation steps, about
   two-thirds of the initially identified genera were eliminated. In
   comparison with the one similar metagenomic study and several earlier
   culture-based ones, our findings change the current conception of the
   oral mycobiome, especially with the discovery of the high prevalence and
   abundance of the genus Malassezia. Previously identified as an important
   pathogen of the skin, and recently reported as the predominant fungal
   genus at the nostril and backs of the head and ear, this is the first
   account of Malassezia in the human mouth. Findings from this study were
   in good agreement with others on the existence of many consensus members
   of the core mycobiome, and on unique patterns for individual subjects.
   This research offered a cautionary note about unconditional acceptance
   of lengthy lists of community members produced by automated assignments,
   provided a roadmap for enhancing the likely biological relevance of
   sequence-based fungal surveys, and built the foundation for
   understanding the role of fungi in health and disease of the oral
   cavity.}},
