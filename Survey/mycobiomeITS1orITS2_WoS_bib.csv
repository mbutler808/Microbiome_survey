However, the distribution of fungal communities in   the ocean, especially the vertical distribution along depth in the water   column, remained poorly understood. Here, we assess the depth-related   distribution pattern of fungal communities along the water column from   epi- to abyssopelagic zones of the Western Pacific Ocean using internal   transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) metabarcoding. Majority of the assigned OTUs   were affiliated to Ascomycota, followed by three other minor phyla   (Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycota). The epipelagic zone   harbored a higher OTU richness with distinct fungal communities as   compared with meso-, bathy-, and abyssopelagic zones. Across the whole   water column, depth appears as a key parameter for both fungal alpha-   and beta-diversity. However, when the dataset was split into the upper   (5-500 m) and deeper (below 500 m) layers, no significant correlation   was observed between depth and community compositions. In the upper   layer, temperature and dissolved oxygen were recognized as the primary   environmental factors shaping fungal alpha- and beta- diversity. By   parsing fungal OTUs into ecological categories, multi-trophic mode of   nutrition was found to be more prevalent with increasing depth,   suggesting a potential adaptation to the extreme conditions of the deep   sea. This study provides new and meaningful information on the   depth-stratified fungal diversity, community structure, and putative   ecological roles in the open sea."

We report a   cross-sectional analysis of 1674 participants from four centers of the   Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), aged 18 to   74 years old at recruitment. Results: Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA   gene V4 and fungal ITS1 fragments from self-collected stool samples   indicate that the host microbiome is determined by sociodemographic and   migration-related variables. Those who relocate from Latin America to   the USA at an early age have reductions in Prevotella to Bacteroides   ratios that persist across the life course. Shannon index of alpha   diversity in fungi and bacteria is low in those who relocate to the USA   in early life. In contrast, those who relocate to the USA during   adulthood, over 45 years old, have high bacterial and fungal diversity   and high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios, compared to USA-born and   childhood arrivals. Low bacterial diversity is associated in turn with   obesity. Contrasting with prior studies, our study of the Latino   population shows increasing Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio with greater   obesity. Taxa within Acidaminococcus, Megasphaera, Ruminococcaceae,   Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, YS2   (Cyanobacteria), and Victivallaceae are significantly associated with   both obesity and earlier exposure to the USA, while Oscillospira and   Anaerotruncus show paradoxical associations with both obesity and   late-life introduction to the USA. Conclusions: Our analysis of the gut   microbiome of Latinos demonstrates unique features that might be   responsible for health disparities affecting Hispanics living in the   USA."

We   characterized the fungal diversity in air samples from sawmill workers'   breathing zones and identified differences in the richness, diversity,   and taxonomic composition between companies, departments, wood types,   and seasons. Full-shift personal inhalable dust samples (n = 86)   collected from 11 industrial sawmill, sorting mill, and planer mill   companies processing spruce and/or pine were subjected to DNA   metabarcoding using the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region   2. The workers were exposed to a higher total number of operational   taxonomic units (OTUs) in summer than in winter and when processing   spruce than when processing pine. Workers in the saw department had the   richest fungal exposure, followed by workers in the planing department   and sorting of dry timber department. Sawmills explained 11\% of the   variation in the fungal community composition of the exposure, followed   by season (5\%) and department (3\%). The fungal compositions of the   exposures also differed between seasons, sawmills, wood types, and   departments at the taxonomic level, ranging from the phylum to the   species level. The differences in exposure diversity suggest that the   potential health effects of fungal inhalation may also be different;   hence, a risk assessment based on the fungal diversity differences   should be performed. This study may serve as a basis for establishing a   fungal profile of signature species that are specific for sawmills and   that can be measured quantitatively in future risk assessments of   sawmill workers.   IMPORTANCE To gain more knowledge about exposure-response relationships,   it is important to improve exposure characterization by comprehensively   identifying the temporal and spatial fungal composition and diversity of   inhalable dust at workplaces. The variation in the diverse fungal   communities to which individuals are exposed in different seasons and   sawmills suggests that variations in exposure-related health effects   between seasons and companies can be expected. More importantly, the   distinct fungal profiles between departments across companies indicate   that workers in different job groups are differently exposed and that   health risks can be department specific. DNA metabarcoding provides   insight into a broad spectrum of airborne fungi that may serve as a   basis for obtaining important knowledge about the fungi to which workers   are exposed."

While the nuclear ribosomal internal   transcribed spacer (ITS) region are recognized as the formal fungal   taxonomic barcode, appraisal of different ITS sub-regions and the   influence of DNA extraction methods have not been comprehensively   undertaken using human respiratory specimens. (2) Methods: We performed   ITS analysis of respiratory (sputum) samples by assessing (a) the effect   of alternate DNA extraction techniques and (b) an evaluation of four   different ITS primer pairs (ITS1F and ITS2; ITS1-30F and ITS1-217R;   gITS7ngs and ITS4ng; and Fseq and Rseq) on the mycobiome profiles   generated for mock fungal communities and their respective clinical   (airway) specimens. (3) Results: Primer pairs varied in their resulting   ITS mycobiome profiles, suggesting that particular pairs may be more   relevant for analysis of respiratory samples compared to others.   Assessment of DNA extraction methods highlighted lower final DNA   concentrations achieved by mechanical disruption compared to enzymatic   lysis. However, despite lower yields, DNA liberated by mechanical lysis   more readily yielded ITS bands with highest success in combination with   the Fseq and Rseq primers. (4) Conclusion: Choice of extraction method,   primers used, and sequencing approach are all important considerations   in sequencing the mycobiome and should be tailored to sample type. A   standardization of approach to mycobiome studies using respiratory   specimens will permit more reliable comparisons between studies and   improve our understanding of the role of fungi in the human airway."

In this study we apply high-throughput sequencing to investigate the   mycobiome of 172 samples of fresh (current year) and aged (3 year old)   needles of Picea glauca from three sites over a distance of 500 km in   Alaska (USA). We analysed Illumina-generated ITS2 sequences to relate   mycobiome data with phenotypic tree traits, measures of genetic   variation and climate variables obtained from long-term monitoring of   the sites.   Alpha-diversity declined with increasing environmental stress/climate   harshness. Fungal communities differed in richness and taxonomic   composition between sites, with a pronounced difference in the relative   abundance of OTUs assigned to species of the rust genus Chrysomyxa,   plant pathogens which seem to have been in an outbreak at two sites at   the time of sampling.   Beside climate parameters, needle age was the second strongest   explanatory variable of the mycobiome composition, whereas we found no   effect of tree genetic variation, indicating that environmental and tree   trait specific variables mainly determined individual white spruce   mycobiomes at Alaska's treelines.

Focusing on cultivated crops, optimized farming practices   must consider the role of these communities when aiming at reducing the   impact of pathogens and increasing yields. Typical inhabitants of   plant's phyllosphere are bacteria and microscopic fungi, some of them   pathogenic for the plant and dangerous for the consumers, due to the   production of toxins. In order to efficiently manage the microbiome, the   natural drivers regulating community assembly must be clearly   understood. In our study we investigated the within field variation of   the phyllosphere mycobiome of wheat ears by metabarcoding of the fungal   internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1). We selected a field   characterized by a high topographic heterogeneity, which is reflected in   differences in plant productivity and fitness across it. Samples were   taken from 30 sampling points laid across the field where data-loggers   were placed, measuring the productivity driven under canopy   microclimate. The microclimatic conditions were tested as a source of   potential environmental variance. Further independent spatial structures   were tested using spatial eigenvector maps (MEMs). Results show   considerable differences in the phyllosphere composition across the   field. The local under canopy environmental conditions at each point   were strong predictors of the community composition. Independent spatial   effects given by the geographical position of the sampling points showed   also a weaker but significant effect. Moreover we observed different   spatial responses from different fungal phyla, with results resembling   those described in studies done at a regional scale. This study is the   first one to investigate the spatial variation of the phyllosphere   mycobiome of a commercial crop within the same field. It contributes to   the study of the epidemiology and community assembly dynamics of wheat   phyllosphere fungi, showing how in-field community variations are the   results of different environmental and spatial processes acting   simultaneously. It also shows how heterogeneous fields are a smart and   useful system to investigate the ecological mechanisms regulating plant   microbiome composition."

Low-dose antibiotics have   historically been used to modulate food production animals and their   microbiome. Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar   modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to   determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a   low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing microbiome. Over   13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a   low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or   without two different probiotics (8 cage units, n = 80 per group).   Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were   characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized   and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome   sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific   kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We   found that development of the early-life microbiome of turkey poults was   tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose   antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not   nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in   overall microbiome composition during development compared to controls.   Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts   in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced   performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that   identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic   combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose   antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing   the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches may also be   beneficial for humans.   IMPORTANCE Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need   for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a   pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance   performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their microbiota, similar   to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that   a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial   turkey gut microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters   than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored   probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth   promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter   and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating   the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches. This work   suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development hold promise   for modulating the avian host and its microbiota."

In this   study, the inhibitory effects of the complex essential oils   (cinnamaldehyde, citral, eugenol, and menthol, 3:3:2:2, v/v) on fungal   growth and mycotoxins production in stored maize were evaluated using   traditional plate counting, internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)   sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Complex   essential oils (0.02\%) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total fungi   counts and the content of aflatoxin B-1, zearalenone, and deoxynivalenol   in stored maize during 12 months of storage, and were more effective   than propionic acid (0.2\%). The fungal diversity of the control group   was the highest with 113 operational taxonomic units. During storage of   maize kernels, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Wallemia, Sarocladium, and   Penicillium were main genera. At 0-6 months, the fungal diversity was   high and Fusarium was predominant genus. However, at 7-11 months, the   fungal diversity was low and Aspergillus was predominant genus. During   the later stages of storage, the prevalence of Aspergillus in maize   treated with essential oils was significantly lower than (p < 0.05) that   observed in the propionic acid treated and control samples. The results   of this study suggest that the complex essential oils may be employed   successfully to control toxigenic fungi and subsequent contamination   with mycotoxins in maize."

However, the aetiology of these effects   is not completely understood, mainly due to the complexity and variety   of potentially causative agents to which workers are exposed during   cereals process. In this study, we characterized the mycobiome during   different steps of wheat processing-harvesting, grain unloading and   straw handling-and compared it to mycobiomes of domestic   environments-rural and urban. To do so, settled dust was collected at a   six month interval for six weeks in the close proximity of 142   participants, 74 occupationally exposed to wheat dust-freshly harvested   or stored-and 68 not occupationally exposed to it. Fungal community   composition was determined in those samples by high-throughput   sequencing of the primary fungal barcode marker internal transcribed   spacer 1 (ITS1). The comparison of different mycobiomes revealed that   fungal richness, as well as their composition, was much higher in the   domestic environment than at the workplace. Furthermore, we found that   the fungal community composition strongly differed between workplaces   where workers handled freshly harvested wheat and those where they   handled stored wheat. Indicator species for each exposed population were   identified. Our results emphasize the complexity of exposure of grain   workers and farmers and open new perspectives in the identification of   the etiological factors responsible for the respiratory pathologies   induced by wheat dust exposure."

In   comparison to bacteria, very little is known about potential sources of   colonizing fungi in the NICU setting. Thus, the objective of this study   was to characterize fungal communities (mycobiomes) of potential   colonization sources for neonates hospitalized in a large university   NICU. We hypothesized that the unit surfaces would contain different   mycobiomes than those of human-associated (breastmilk) sources. We   characterized mycobiomes of NICU surfaces of multiple individual patient   care areas as well as those of breastmilk samples by sequencing the   internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) of the fungal rDNA locus. We   found that, across all samples, Candida and Saccharomyces species were   the most prevalent taxa and had the greatest relative abundances.   Breastmilk samples had significantly higher fungal alpha-diversities   than NICU surface samples and fungal community compositions (beta   diversities) differed significantly between the two sample types.   Mycobiome compositions were predominantly driven by the relative   abundances of three fungal taxa: Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis,   and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In total, 21 individual fungal taxa showed   significantly greater relative abundances in breastmilk as compared to   NICU surfaces, with three being of particular interest to human health:   Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Since   no fungal DNA was detected when whole breastmilk was used as the DNA   template, as opposed to breastmilk subjected to cell lysis during the   DNA isolation procedure, our results indicate that DNA is from fungal   cells and is not cell-free DNA. In summary, both NICU surfaces and human   breastmilk harbor distinct fungal communities that could provide a   source of fungi for the developing infant gut mycobiota. In particular,   Candida and Saccharomyces species are abundant and prevalent for both of   these potential sources that infants are exposed to."

It   is known that each step may bias the results. These biases have been   explored for the study of bacterial communities, but rarely for fungi.   Our aim was therefore to evaluate methods for the study of the gut   mycobiome. We first evaluated DNA extraction methods in fungal cultures   relevant to the gut. Afterwards, to assess how these methods would   behave with an actual sample, stool from a donor was spiked with cells   from the same cultures. We found that different extraction kits favour   some species and bias against others. In terms of amplicon sequencing,   we evaluated five primer sets, two for ITS2 and one for ITS1, 185 and   285 rRNA. Results showed that 185 rRNA outperformed the other markers:   it was able to amplify all the species in the mock community and to   discriminate among them. ITS primers showed both amplification and   sequencing biases, the latter related to the variable length of the   product.

However, it is unknown whether the gut   mycobiota composition can create an immune environment that would   influence the immune response to a newly introduced intestinal fungus.   Using ITS1 deep sequencing, we evaluated the mycobiome structure of   C57BL/6J mice acquired from Jackson (JAX) or bred in a controlled   environment at a dedicated room in our own mouse facility (WCM-CE) for   several generations. We found that C57BL/6J mice from these segregated   mouse colonies harbor dramatically different mycobiota. To assess   whether the mycobiota make up can influence immune responses to   colonization with a fungus foreign to the murine GI tract, we colonized   JAX and WCM-CE mice with the human commensal C. albicans and measured   Th17 responses in the gut.

In 2013, cases of gastrointestinal illness after yogurt   consumption were reported to the US FDA, and the producer found that its   products were contaminated with Mucor. A previous study found that the   Mucor strain isolated from an open contaminated yogurt exhibited   virulence in a murine systemic infection model and showed that this   strain is capable of surviving passage through the gastrointestinal   tract of mice. In this study, we isolated another Mucor strain from an   unopened yogurt that is closely related but distinct from the first   Mucor strain and subsequently examined if Mucor alters the gut   microbiota in a murine host model. DNA extracted from a ten-day course   of stool samples was used to analyze the microbiota in the   gastrointestinal tracts of mice exposed via ingestion of Mucor spores.   The bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 sequences obtained were used   to identify taxa of each kingdom. Linear regressions revealed that there   are changes in bacterial and fungal abundance in the gastrointestinal   tracts of mice which ingested Mucor. Furthermore, we found an increased   abundance of the bacterial genus Bacteroides and a decreased abundance   of the bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila in the gastrointestinal tracts   of exposed mice. Measurements of abundances show shifts in relative   levels of multiple bacterial and fungal taxa between mouse groups. These   findings suggest that exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to Mucor   can alter the microbiota and, more importantly, illustrate an   interaction between the intestinal mycobiota and bacteriota. In   addition, Mucor was able to induce increased permeability in epithelial   cell monolayers in vitro, which might be indicative of unstable   intestinal barriers. Understanding how the gut microbiota is shaped is   important to understand the basis of potential methods of treatment for   gastrointestinal illness. How the gut microbiota changes in response to   exposure, even by pathogens not considered to be causative agents of   food-borne illness, may be important to how commercial food producers   prevent and respond to contamination of products aimed at the public.   This study provides evidence that the fungal microbiota, though   understudied, may play an important role in diseases of the human gut."

In the present work, we aimed to determine whether the   healthy human breast milk mycobiota is influenced by geographical   location and mode of delivery, as well as to investigate its interaction   with bacterial profiles in the same samples. A total of 80 mature breast   milk samples from 4 different countries were analyzed by Illumina   sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region, joining   the 18S and 5.8S regions of the fungal rRNA region. Basidiomycota and   Ascomycota were found to be the dominant phyla, with Malassezia and   Davidiella being the most prevalent genera across countries. A core   formed by Malassezia, Davidiella, Sistotrema, and Penicillium was shared   in the milk samples from the different origins, although specific shifts   in mycobiome composition were associated with geographic location and   delivery mode. The presence of fungi in the breast milk samples was   further confirmed by culture and isolate characterization, and fungal   loads were estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the fungal   ITS1 region.

The   presence of a breast milk mycobiome was confirmed in all samples   analyzed, regardless of the geographic origin.   IMPORTANCE During recent years, human breast milk has been documented as   a potential source of bacteria for the newborn. Recently, we have   reported the presence of fungi in breast milk from healthy mothers. It   is well known that environmental and perinatal factors can affect milk   bacteria; however, the impact on milk fungi is still unknown. The   current report describes fungal communities (mycobiota) in breast milk   samples across different geographic locations and the influence of the   mode of delivery. We also provide novel insights on bacterium-fungus   interactions, taking into account environmental and perinatal factors.   We identified a core of four genera shared across locations, consisting   of Malassezia, Davidiella, Sistotrema, and Penicillium, which have been   reported to be present in the infant gut.

We   hypothesized that patients' serologic responses were affected by their   consumption of dietary sugars. This study analyzed the correlations   between antiglycan antibody expression and dietary sugar consumption in   patients with UC pouch and the evolution in antibody levels over time.   Methods: Patients were followed prospectively for 2 consecutive visits.   The following antiglycan carbohydrate antibodies were detected by   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: antichitobioside (ACCA),   antilaminaribioside (ALCA), antimannobioside (AMCA), and   anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) antibodies. Patients completed a   food frequency questionnaire. The fungal community in patients' fecal   samples was analyzed by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer 2   (ITS2) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA.   Results: We included 75 UC pouch patients aged 45.2 +/- 14 years who   underwent pouch surgery 9.8 +/- 6.7 years previously. Of these patients,   34.7\% (n = 26) showed seropositivity for antiglycan antibodies. Starch   consumption was significantly higher in patients with positive serologic   responses (P = 0.05). Higher starch consumption was associated with   higher AMCA and ACCA titers, which increased by 4.08\% (0.8\%-7.4\%; P =   0.014) and 4.8\% (0.7\%-9.1\%; P = 0.007), respectively, for each 10-g   increase of dietary starch. The per-patient change in the relative   abundance of Candida albicans in fecal samples correlated positively   with changes in starch consumption (Spearman's r = 0.72; P = 0.012).   Conclusions: Starch consumption correlated with positive antiglycan   serology (ACCA and AMCA), suggesting that increased dietary starch   intake may promote a specific immune response in patients with IBD."

Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicon   sequencing and a custom analysis pipeline detected 96\% of species from   three mock communities comprised of potential fungal lung pathogens with   good recapitulation of the expected species distributions (Pearson   correlation coefficients r = 0.63, p = 0.004; r = 0.71, p < 0.001; r =   0.62, p = 0.002). We used this pipeline to analyze mycobiomes of   bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens classified as culture-negative (n   = 50) or culture-positive (n = 39) for Blastomyces   dermatitidis/gilchristii, the causative agent of North America   blastomycosis. Detected in 91.4\% of the culture-positive samples,   Blastomyces dominated (>50\% relative abundance) the mycobiome in 68.6\%   of these culture-positive samples but was absent in culturenegative   samples. To overcome any bias in relative abundance due to   between-sample variation in fungal biomass, an abundance-weighting   calculation was used to normalize the data by accounting for   sample-specific PCR cycle number and PCR product concentration data   utilized during sample preparation. After normalization, there was a   statistically significant greater overall abundance of ITS1 amplicon in   the Blastomycesculture-positive samples versus culture-negative samples.   Moreover, the normalization revealed a greater biomass of yeast and   environmental fungi in several Blastomycesculture-positive samples than   in the culture-negative samples. Successful detection of Coccidioides,   Scedosporium, Phaeoacremonium, and Aspergillus in 6 additional   culture-positive BALs by ITS1 amplicon sequencing demonstrates the   ability of this method to detect a broad range of fungi from clinical   specimens, suggesting that it may be a potentially useful adjunct to   traditional fungal microbiological testing for the diagnosis of   respiratory mycoses."

Fungi and bacteria coexist in the   human gut and interact with each other. Although they have been shown to   contribute actively to health or disease, no studies have investigated   whether the fungal microbiota in AS patients is perturbed. In this   study, fecal samples from 22 AS patients, with clinical and radiographic   assessments, and 16 healthy controls (HCs) were collected to   systematically characterize the gut microbiota and mycobiota in AS   patients by 16S rRNA gene- and ITS2-based DNA sequencing. Our results   showed that the microbiota of AS patients was characterized by increased   abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased Bacteroidetes, which was   contributed by enrichment of Escherichia-Shigella, Veillonella, La   NK4A136 group, and reduction of Prevotella strain 9, Megamona, and   Fusobacterium. The gut mycobiota of AS patients was characterized by   higher levels of Ascomycota, especially the class of Dothideomycetes,   and decreased abundance of Basidiomycota, which was mainly contributed   by the decease of Agaricales. Compared to HCs, decreased ITS2/16S   biodiversity ratios and altered bacterial-fungal interkingdom networks   were observed in AS patients. Compared with nonsteroidal   anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), treating AS patients with biological   agents induced obvious changes in the gut mycobiota, and this result was   highly associated with disease activity indexes, including AS disease   activity index (ASDAS) C-reactive protein (asCRP), erythrocyte   sedimentation rate (ESR), and Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI).   In addition, altered mycobiota in AS patients was also found associated   with the degree of radiographic damage.   IMPORTANCE The human gut is colonized by diverse fungi (mycobiota), and   fungi have long been suspected in the pathogenesis of SpA. Our study   unraveled a disease-specific interkingdom network alteration in AS,   suggesting that fungi, or the interkingdom interactions between bacteria   and fungi, may play an essential role in AS development.

Oral mycobiome   composition was assessed by using Illumina MiSeq to sequence the ITS2   region, which was amplified from dental plaque. This revealed that the   oral mycobiome in the investigated children contained 46 fungal species.   Candida albicans was the most abundant species and was ubiquitous in all   samples, indicating this species may not be involved in caries   development as previously suggested. While the overall diversity of   fungi was similar, independent of caries status (p > 0.05), we found   caries influenced the abundance of specific fungi. Children without   caries had a significantly higher abundance of 17 species compared to   children with caries, which had three enriched species (p < 0.001).

Methods   Fecal samples from healthy adults were stored at -80'C as such or   diluted in RNAlater0 and subjected to 2 extraction protocols with   mechanical lysis: the Powersoil (R) MoBio kit or the International Human   Microbiota Standard (IHMS) Protocol Q.

Results   We obtained 171869 and 199089 quality-controlled reads for 16S and ITS,   respectively. All 16S reads were assigned to 41 bacterial genera; only   52\% of ITS reads were assigned to 40 fungal genera/section. Rarefaction   curves were satisfactory in 3/3 and 2/3 subjects for 16S and ITS,   respectively. PCoA showed important inter-individual variability of   intestinal microbiota largely overweighing the effect of storage or   extraction. Storage in RNAlater (R) impacted (downward trend) the   relative abundances of 7/41 bacterial and 6/40 fungal taxa, while   extraction impacted randomly 18/41 bacterial taxa and 1/40 fungal taxon.

For combined bacterial and fungal intestinal   microbiota analysis, immediate sample freezing should be preferred when   feasible, but storage in RNAlater (R) remains an option under   unfavourable conditions or for concomitant metatranscriptomic analysis;   and extraction should rely on protocols validated for bacterial   analysis, such as IHMS Protocol Q, and including a powerful mechanical   lysis, essential for fungal extraction."

Studies characterizing infant microbial colonization have focused mostly   on bacteria in the microbiome and have largely neglected fungi (the   mycobiome), despite their relevance to mucosal infections in healthy   infants. In this pilot study, we characterized the skin, oral, and anal   mycobiomes of infants over the first month of life (n = 17) and the anal   and vaginal mycobiomes of mothers (n = 16) by internal transcribed   spacer 2 (ITS2) amplicon sequencing. We found that infant mycobiomes   differed by body site, with the infant mycobiomes at the anal sites   being different from those at the skin and oral sites. The relative   abundances of body site-specific taxa differed by birth mode, with   significantly more Candida albicans fungi present on the skin of   vaginally born infants on day 30 and significantly more Candida   orthopsilosis fungi present in the oral cavity of caesarean section-born   infants throughout the first month of life. We found the mycobiomes   within individual infants to be variable over the first month of life,   and vaginal birth did not result in infant mycobiomes that were more   similar to the mother's vaginal mycobiome. Therefore, although vertical   transmission of specific fungal isolates from mother to infant has been   reported, it is likely that other sources (environment, other   caregivers) also contribute to early-life mycobiome establishment. Thus,   future longitudinal studies of mycobiome and bacterial microbiome   codevelopment, with dense sampling from birth to beyond the first month   of life, are warranted.   IMPORTANCE Humans are colonized by diverse fungi (mycobiome), which have   received much less study to date than colonizing bacteria. We know very   little about the succession of fungal colonization in early life and   whether it may relate to long-term health. To better understand fungal   colonization and its sources, we studied the skin, oral, and anal   mycobiomes of healthy term infants and the vaginal and anal mycobiomes   of their mothers. Generally, infants were colonized by few fungal taxa,   and fungal alpha diversity did not increase over the first month of   life. There was no clear community maturation over the first month of   life, regardless of body site. Key body-site-specific taxa, but not   overall fungal community structures, were impacted by birth mode. Thus,   additional studies to characterize mycobiome acquisition and succession   throughout early life are needed to form a foundation for research into   the relationship between mycobiome development and human disease."

The traditional approach used direct observations based on   morphology, single spore isolation and phylogenetic analysis yielding 45   taxa which 19 were commonly detected in both cultivars. The same set of   samples were then used for Illumina sequencing which analyzed ITS1   sequence data and detected 226 fungal OTUs, of which 176 and 189 belong   to the cultivars Carbanate Gernischet and Red Globe, respectively.

In the Carbanate Gernischet cultivar, Ascomycota accounted   for 77\% of the OTUs and in Red Globe, almost all sequenced were   Ascomycota. The fungal taxa overlap at the genus and species level   between the traditional and culture-independent approach was relatively   low. In the traditional approach we were able to identify the taxa to   species level, while in the culture-independent method we were   frequently able to identify the taxa to family or genus level.

Main conclusions: Fungi are generally considered to have excellent   dispersal potentials and marine fungi have the potential to disperse far   and wide in an environment that has no obvious barriers to dispersal.

We speculate that limited dispersal and differences in   habitat type are responsible for the observed pattern. Work examining   biogeographical patterns in marine fungi is still in its infancy and   further research is required to fully understand marine fungal   biogeography."

However, many of the fungi most commonly detected   in stool samples are also present in food or the oral cavity. Therefore,   to recognize which gut fungi are likely to have a sustained influence on   human health, there is a need to separate transient members of the GI   tract from true colonizers. To identify colonizing fungi, the eukaryotic   rRNA operon's second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) was sequenced   from the stool, saliva, and food of healthy adults following consumption   of different controlled diets. Unlike most bacterial 16S rRNA genes, the   only fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in stool   DNA across multiple diets were also present in saliva and/or food.   Additional analyses, including culture-based approaches and sequencing   of the 18S rRNA gene, ITS2 cDNA, and DNA extracted using alternative   methods, failed to detect additional fungi. Two abundant fungi,   Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, were examined further in   healthy volunteers. Saccharomyces became undetectable in stool when a S.   cerevisiae-free diet was consumed, and the levels of C. albicans in   stool were dramatically reduced by more frequent cleaning of teeth.   Extremely low fungal abundance, the inability of fungi to grow under   conditions mimicking the distal gut, and evidence from analysis of other   public datasets further support the hypothesis that fungi do not   routinely colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults.   IMPORTANCE We sought to identify the fungi that colonize healthy GI   tracts and that have a sustained influence on the diverse functions of   the gut microbiome. Instead, we found that all fungi in the stool of   healthy volunteers could be explained by their presence in oral and   dietary sources and that our results, together with those from other   analyses, support the model that there is little or no gastrointestinal   colonization by fungi. This may be due to Westernization, primate   evolution, fungal ecology, and/or the strong defenses of a healthy   immune system. Importantly, fungal colonization of the GI tract may   often be indicative of disease. As fungi can cause serious infections in   immunocompromised individuals and are found at increased abundance in   multiple disorders of the GI tract, understanding normal fungal   colonization is essential for proper treatment and prevention of fungal   pathogenesis."

Sputum samples from four CF patients were cultured and analysed   by DNA extractions followed by terminal restriction fragment length   polymorphism analysis through resolution of bacterial ribosomal gene   (rDNA) fragments, and cloning plus sequencing of part of fungal rRNA   genes. These approaches were compared with UDS method targeting 16S rDNA   gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 region of rDNA.

The mean number of genera detected by UDS per patient was   statistically higher than by culture or FGS methods. Patients with   severe airway disease as assessed by standard spirometry exhibited a   reduced fungal and bacterial diversity. UDS approach evaluates more   extensively the diversity of fungal and bacterial flora compared with   cultures. However, it currently remains difficult to routinely use UDS   mainly because of the lack of standardization, and the current cost of   this method."

Without   taxonomic classification, functional and biological information of   microbial communities cannot be inferred or interpreted. The internal   transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA is the conventional   marker region for fungal community studies. While bioinformatics   pipelines that cluster reads into OTUs have received much attention in   the literature, less attention has been given to the taxonomic   classification of these sequences, upon which biological inference is   dependent.   Results: Here we compare how three common fungal OTU taxonomic   assignment tools (RDP Classifier, UTAX, and SINTAX) handle ITS fungal   sequence data. The classification power, defined as the proportion of   assigned OTUs at a given taxonomic rank, varied among the classifiers.   Classifiers were generally consistent (assignment of the same taxonomy   to a given OTU) across datasets and ranks; a small number of OTUs were   assigned unique classifications across programs. We developed CONSTAX   (CONSensus TAXonomy), a Python tool that compares taxonomic   classifications of the three programs and merges them into an improved   consensus taxonomy. This tool also produces summary classification   outputs that are useful for downstream analyses.   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that independent taxonomy   assignment tools classify unique members of the fungal community, and   greater classification power is realized by generating consensus   taxonomy of available classifiers with CONSTAX."

To date, human gut mycobiome   studies have primarily been disease centric or in small cohorts of   healthy individuals. To contribute to existing knowledge of the human   mycobiome, we investigated the gut mycobiome of the Human Microbiome   Project (HMP) cohort by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2   (ITS2) region as well as the 18S rRNA gene.   Results: Three hundred seventeen HMP stool samples were analyzed by ITS2   sequencing. Fecal fungal diversity was significantly lower in comparison   to bacterial diversity. Yeast dominated the samples, comprising eight of   the top 15 most abundant genera. Specifically, fungal communities were   characterized by a high prevalence of Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and   Candida, with S. cerevisiae, M. restricta, and C. albicans operational   taxonomic units (OTUs) present in 96. 8, 88.3, and 80.8\% of samples,   respectively. There was a high degree of inter-and intra-volunteer   variability in fungal communities. However, S. cerevisiae, M. restricta,   and C. albicans OTUs were found in 92.2, 78.3, and 63.6\% of volunteers,   respectively, in all samples donated over an approximately 1-year   period. Metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data agreed with ITS2   results; however, ITS2 sequencing provided greater resolution of the   relatively low abundance mycobiome constituents.   Conclusions: Compared to bacterial communities, the human gut mycobiome   is low in diversity and dominated by yeast including Saccharomyces,   Malassezia, and Candida. Both inter-and intra-volunteer variability in   the HMP cohort were high, revealing that unlike bacterial communities,   an individual's mycobiome is no more similar to itself over time than to   another person's. Nonetheless, several fungal species persisted across a   majority of samples, evidence that a core gut mycobiome may exist. ITS2   sequencing data provided greater resolution of the mycobiome membership   compared to metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data, suggesting   that it is a more sensitive method for studying the mycobiome of stool   samples."

To date, characterization of   microbiota in lean versus obese subjects has been dominated by studies   of gut bacteria. Fungi, recently shown to affect gut inflammation, have   received little study for their role in obesity. We sought to determine   the effects of high-fat diet on fungal and bacterial community   structures in a mouse model using the internal transcribed spacer region   2 (ITS2) of fungal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the 16S rRNA genes of   bacteria. Mice fed a high-fat diet had significantly different   abundances of 19 bacterial and 6 fungal taxa than did mice fed standard   chow, with high-fat diet causing similar magnitudes of change in overall   fungal and bacterial microbiome structures. We observed strong and   complex diet-specific coabundance relationships between intra-and   interkingdom microbial pairs and dramatic reductions in the number of   coabundance correlations in mice fed a high-fat diet compared to those   fed standard chow. Furthermore, predicted microbiome functional modules   related to metabolism were significantly less abundant in   high-fat-diet-fed than in standard-chow-fed mice. These results suggest   a role for fungi and interkingdom interactions in the association   between gut microbiomes and obesity.   IMPORTANCE Recent research shows that gut microbes are involved in the   development of obesity, a growing health problem in developed countries   that is linked to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However,   studies showing links between microbes and metabolism have been limited   to the analysis of bacteria and have ignored the potential contribution   of fungi in metabolic health. This study provides evidence that   ingestion of a high-fat diet is associated with changes to the fungal   (and bacterial) microbiome in a mouse model. In addition, we find that   interkingdom structural and functional relationships exist between fungi   and bacteria within the gut and that these are perturbed by high-fat   diet."

The lichen-inhabiting   fungi either develop diagnostic phenotypes or occur asymptomatically.   Because the degree of specificity towards the lichen host is poorly   known, we studied the diversity of these fungi among neighbouring   lichens on rocks in an alpine habitat. Using a sequencing metabarcoding   approach, we show that lichen mycobiomes clearly reflect the overlap of   multiple ecological sets of taxa, which differ in their trophic   association with lichen thalli. The lack of specificity to the lichen   mycobiome is further supported by the lack of community structure   observed using clustering and ordination methods. The communities   encountered across samples largely result from the subsampling of a   shared species pool, in which we identify three major ecological   components: (i) a generalist environmental pool, (ii) a   lichenicolous/endolichenic pool and (iii) a pool of transient species.   These taxa majorly belong to the fungal classes Dothideomycetes,   Eurotiomycetes and Tremellomycetes with close relatives in adjacent   ecological niches. We found no significant evidence that the   phenotypically recognized lichenicolous fungi influence the occurrence   of the other asymptomatic fungi in the host thalli. We claim that   lichens work as suboptimal habitats or as a complex spore and mycelium   bank, which modulate and allow the regeneration of local fungal   communities. By performing an approach that minimizes ambiguities in the   taxonomic assignments of fungi, we present how lichen mycobiomes are   also suitable targets for improving bioinformatic analyses of fungal   metabarcoding."

However, our knowledge of WIF richness   and distribution patterns in different forest biomes is limited. Here,   we used pyrotag sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer   (ITS2) region to characterize the deadwood mycobiome of two tree species   with greatly different wood characteristics (Schima superba and Pinus   massoniana) in a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. Specifically, we   tested (i) the effects of tree species and wood quality properties on   WIF OTU richness and community composition; (ii) the role of biotic and   abiotic factors in shaping the WIF communities; and (iii) the   relationship between WIF OTU richness, community composition and   decomposition rates. Due to different wood chemical properties, we   hypothesized that the WIF communities derived from the two tree species   would be correlated differently with biotic and abiotic factors. Our   results show that deadwood in subtropical forests harbors diverse fungal   communities comprising six ecological functional groups. We found   interesting colonization patterns for this subtropical biome, where   Resinicium spp. were highly detected in both broadleaved and coniferous   deadwood. In addition, the members of Xylariales were frequently found   in Schima. The two deadwood species differed significantly in WIF OTU   richness (Pinus > Schima) and community composition (P < 0.001).   Variations in WIF community composition of both tree species were   significantly explained by wood pH and ecological factors (biotic:   deadwood species, basal area and abiotic: soil pH), but the WIF   communities derived from each tree species correlated differently with   abiotic factors. Interestingly, we found that deadwood decomposition   rate significantly correlated with WIF communities and negatively   correlated with WIF OTU richness. We conclude that the pattern of WIF   OTU richness and community composition are controlled by multiple   interacting biotic and abiotic factors. Overall, our study provides an   in-depth picture of the deadwood mycobiome in this subtropical forest.   Furthermore, by comparing our results to results from temperate and   boreal forests we contribute to a better understanding of patterns of   WIF communities across different biomes and geographic locations."

Polymicrobial biofilms in the wound bed   are hypothesized to disrupt the highly coordinated and sequential events   of cutaneous healing. Both culture-dependent and -independent studies of   the chronic-wound microbiome have almost exclusively focused on   bacteria, omitting what we hypothesize are important fungal   contributions to impaired healing and the development of complications.   Here we show for the first time that fungal communities (the mycobiome)   in chronic wounds are predictive of healing time, associated with poor   outcomes, and form mixed fungal-bacterial biofilms. We longitudinally   profiled 100, nonhealing diabetic-foot ulcers with high-throughput   sequencing of the pan-fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) locus,   estimating that up to 80\% of wounds contain fungi, whereas cultures   performed in parallel captured only 5\% of colonized wounds. The   ``mycobiome'' was highly heterogeneous over time and between subjects.   Fungal diversity increased with antibiotic administration and onset of a   clinical complication. The proportions of the phylum Ascomycota were   significantly greater (P = 0.015) at the beginning of the study in   wounds that took >8 weeks to heal. Wound necrosis was distinctly   associated with pathogenic fungal species, while taxa identified as   allergenic filamentous fungi were associated with low levels of systemic   inflammation. Directed culturing of wounds stably colonized by pathogens   revealed that interkingdom biofilms formed between yeasts and coisolated   bacteria. Combined, our analyses provide enhanced resolution of the   mycobiome during impaired wound healing, its role in chronic disease,   and impact on clinical outcomes.   IMPORTANCE Wounds are an underappreciated but serious complication for a   diverse spectrum of diseases. High-risk groups, such as persons with   diabetes, have a 25\% lifetime risk of developing a wound that can   become chronic. The majority of microbiome research related to chronic   wounds is focused on bacteria, but the association of fungi with   clinical outcomes remains to be elucidated. Here we describe the dynamic   fungal communities in 100 diabetic patients with foot ulcers. We found   that communities are unstable over time, but at the first clinical   presentation, the relative proportions of different phyla predict   healing times.

By contrast, the tree   genetic identity cannot be benchmarked as a dominant driver for   needle-inhabiting mycobiomes, at least not for white spruce in this   extreme environment."

Currently, the majority of skin   microbiome investigations are limited to characterizing prokaryotic   communities, and our understanding of the skin fungal community   (mycobiome) is limited, more so for cohorts outside of the western   hemisphere. Here, the skin mycobiome across healthy Chinese individuals   in Hong Kong are characterized.   Results: Based on a curated fungal reference database designed for skin   mycobiome analyses, previously documented common skin colonizers are   also abundant and prevalent in this cohort. However, genera associated   with local terrains, food, and medicine are also detected. Fungal   community composition shows interpersonal (Bray-Curtis ANOSIM = 0. 398)   and household (Bray-Curtis ANOSIM = 0.134) clustering. Roles of gender   and age on diversity analyses are test-and site-specific, and, contrary   to bacteria, the effect of household on fungal community composition   dissimilarity between samples is insignificant. Site-specific,   cross-domain positive and negative correlations at both community and   operational taxonomic unit levels may uncover potential relationships   between fungi and bacteria on skin.   Conclusions: The studied Chinese population presents similar major   fungal skin colonizers that are also common in western populations, but   local outdoor environments and lifestyles may also contribute to   mycobiomes of specific cohorts. Cohabitation plays an insignificant role   in shaping mycobiome differences between individuals in this cohort.   Increased understanding of fungal communities of non-western cohorts   will contribute to understanding the size of the global skin   pan-mycobiome, which will ultimately help understand relationships   between environmental exposures, microbial populations, and the health   of global humans."

The   fungal diversity in in-shell peanuts was higher with 110 operational   taxonomic units (OTUs) and 41 genera than peanut kernels (91 OTUs and 37   genera). This means that the micro-environment in shell is more suitable   for maintaining fungal diversity. At 20-30 d, Rhizopus, Eurotium and   Wallemia were predominant in in-shell peanuts. In peanut kernels,   Rhizopus (>30\%) and Eurotium (>20\%) were predominant at 10-20 d and 30   d, respectively. The relative abundances of Rhizopus, Eurotium and   Wallemia were higher than Aspergillus, because they were xerophilic and   grew well on substrates with low water activity (a(w)). During growth,   they released metabolic water, thereby favoring the growth of   Aspergillus. Therefore, from 30 to 90 d, the relative abundance of   Aspergillus increased while that of Rhizopus, Eurotium and Wallemia   decreased. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) revealed that peanuts   stored for 60-90 days and for 10-30 days clustered differently from each   other. Due to low a(w\textbackslash) values (0.34-0.72) and low levels   of A. flavus, nine of 51 samples were contaminated with aflatoxins."

In the present study, we analysed Illumina-generated fungal ITS1   sequences from European beech (Fagus sylvatica) originating from natural   habitats at two different altitudes in the German Alps and from a   managed tree nursery in northern Germany. In general, leaf-inhabiting   mycobiome diversity and composition correlated significantly with the   origin of the trees. Under natural condition the mycobiome was more   diverse at lower than at higher elevation, whereas fungal diversity was   lowest in the artificial habitat of the tree nursery. We further   identified significant correlation of leaf chlorophylls and flavonoids   with both habitat parameters and mycobiome biodiversity.

The climatic data showed that the spring   of 2014 was very dry and without precipitation in the two weeks around   flowering. An initial quantitative PCR showed that the total amount of   fungal DNA increased during the entire period, without significant   difference between sprayed and control wheat heads. Amplicon sequencing   of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region showed that   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified as Sporobolomyces roseus   dominated in the first weeks, whereas Alternaria infectoria OTUs   dominated in the last weeks before harvest. The only observed   significant difference was that the control wheat heads contained more   of the powdery mildew causing Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici OTUs   compared with the sprayed wheat heads. The dry conditions around   flowering most likely also had an effect on Fusarium head blight   infection as Fusarium OTUs were only sporadically encountered.   Analyses of secondary metabolites produced by Fusarium and Alternaria in   the wheat heads confirmed the observations from the amplicon sequencing.   Enniatin B was the most frequent contaminant present in four sprayed   (49-538 ng/g) and three control (56-355 ng/g) wheat heads. The A.   infectoria secondary metabolites infectopyrone and 4Z-infectopyrone were   however consistently observed in all samples collected the last five   weeks before harvest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study,   farm-saved seeds, collected from four villages in Northern Burkina Faso,   were surface sterilized and the distribution of fungal DNA in seeds and   seven-day-old seedlings was analyzed by 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)   amplicon sequencing. More than 99\% of the fungal rDNA was found to   originate from ascomycetes. The distribution of ascomycetes at species   level was subsequently analyzed by barcoding of ITS2 rDNA. Eighteen   Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified from seedlings,   compared to 29 OTUs from seeds. The top-eight most abundant ascomycete   OTUs from seedlings were annotated as: Epicoccum sorghinum, Fusarium   thapsinum, four different Curvuloria spp., Exserohilum rostratum and   Alternaria longissima. These OTUs were also present in amplicons from   seed samples collected in Central Burkina Faso confirming a common   occurrence. E. sorghinum was highly predominant in seedlings both   measured by DNA analysis and by isolation. The dominance of E. sorghinum   was particularly strong in roots from poorly growing seedlings.   Pathogenicity of E. sorghinum isolates was compared to F. thapsinum by   inoculation to seeds in vitro. Both fungal species caused significant   inhibition of seedling growth (P < 0.001) and Koch's postulates were   fulfilled. Extensive, dark necrosis in roots was a typical symptom of E.   sorghinum, whereas wilting of leaves was caused primarily by F.   thapsinum.

Mycobiome in peanuts is critical for aflatoxin production   and food safety. To evaluate the biodiversity and ecological   characteristics of whole communities in stored peanuts, the barcoded   Illumina paired-end sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2   (ITS2) region of rDNA was used to characterize the peanut mycobiome   monthly over a period of 1 year at four main peanut grown areas, i.e.,   Liaoning (LN, North East), Shandong (SD, East), Hubei (HB, Central), and   Guangdong (GD, South) provinces. The fungal diversity of peanuts stored   in SD was the highest with 98 OTUs and 43 genera, followed by LN, HB and   GD. In peanuts stored in SD, Rhizopus, Emericella, and Clonostachys were   predominant. In peanuts from LN, Penicillium, Eurotium, and Clonostachys   were abundant. In peanuts from HB, Penicillium, Eurotium, and   Aspergillus were higher. In GD peanuts, Eurotium, Aspergillus, and   Emericella were mainly seen. The abundances of Aspergillus in LN, SD,   HB, and GD were 0.53, 6.29, 10.86, and 25.75\%, respectively. From the   North of China to the South, that increased over the latitude,   suggesting that the higher temperature and relative humidity might   increase the risk of peanuts contaminated with Aspergillus and   aflatoxins. During the storage, Aspergillus levels were higher at 7-12   months than in 0-6 months, suggesting that the risk increases over   storage time. At 7-10 months, AFB(1) was higher in four areas, while   declined further. The reduction of AFB(1) might be attributed to the   inhibition and degradation of AFB(1) by Aspergillus niger or to the   combination with the compounds of peanuts. This is the first study that   identified the mycobiome and its variation in stored peanuts using ITS2   sequencing technology, and provides the basis for a detailed   characterization of whole mycobiome in peanuts."

Using representative gastrointestinal   tract fungi to build a known ``mock'' library, we examine how this   sequence variability affects data quality derived from Illumina Miseq   and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing pipelines. Also, while analysis of   bacterial 16S profiles is facilitated by the presence of high-quality   well-accepted databases of bacterial 16S sequences, such an accepted   database has not yet emerged to facilitate fungal ITS sequence   characterization, and we observe that redundant and inconsistent ITS1   sequence representation in publically available fungal reference   databases affect quantitation and annotation of species in the gut.

The disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often involves chronic   airway colonization by bacteria and fungi, and these infections cause   irreversible lung damage. Fungi are detected more frequently in CF   sputum samples upon initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and several   studies have implicated the detection of fungi in sputum with worse   outcomes. Thus, a more complete understanding of fungi in CF is   required.   Results: We characterized the fungi and bacteria in expectorated sputa   from six CF subjects. Samples were collected upon admission for systemic   antibacterial therapy and upon the completion of treatment and analyzed   using a pyrosequencing-based analysis of fungal internal transcribed   spacer 1 (ITS1) and bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. A mixture of Candida   species and Malassezia dominated the mycobiome in all samples (74\%-99\%   of fungal reads). There was not a striking trend correlating fungal and   bacterial richness, and richness showed a decline after antibiotic   therapy particularly for the bacteria. The fungal communities within a   sputum sample resembled other samples from that subject despite the   aggressive antibacterial therapy. Quantitative PCR analysis of fungal   18S rDNA sequences to assess fungal burden showed variation in fungal   density in sputum before and after antibacterial therapy but no   consistent directional trend. Analysis of Candida ITS1 sequences   amplified from sputum or pure culture-derived genomic DNA from   individual Candida species found little (<0.5\%) or no variation in ITS1   sequences within or between strains, thereby validating this locus for   the purpose of Candida species identification. We also report the   enhancement of the publically available Visualization and Analysis of   Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) tool for the analysis of fungal   communities in clinical samples.   Conclusions: Fungi are present in CF respiratory sputum. In CF, the use   of intravenous antibiotic therapy often does not profoundly impact   bacterial community structure, and we observed a similar stability in   fungal species composition. Further studies are required to predict the   effects of antibacterials on fungal burden in CF and fungal community   stability in non-CF populations."

Their roles as modifiers of health mandate accurate portrayals   of fungal communities in humans. As an entry point into the airways and   gastrointestinal tract, fungi in the mouth are relevant to several   biocompartments. We have revised current practices in sequence-based   taxonomy assignments and employed the improvements to address the   question of the fungal genera present in the healthy human mouth. The   human oral mycobiome was surveyed using massively parallel, high   throughput sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicons   from saliva following robust extraction methods. Taxonomy was assigned   by comparison to a curated reference dataset, followed by filtering with   an empirically determined BLAST E-value match statistic (10(-42)).   Nomenclature corrections further refined results by conjoining redundant   names for a single fungal genus. Following these curation steps, about   two-thirds of the initially identified genera were eliminated. In   comparison with the one similar metagenomic study and several earlier   culture-based ones, our findings change the current conception of the   oral mycobiome, especially with the discovery of the high prevalence and   abundance of the genus Malassezia. Previously identified as an important   pathogen of the skin, and recently reported as the predominant fungal   genus at the nostril and backs of the head and ear, this is the first   account of Malassezia in the human mouth. Findings from this study were   in good agreement with others on the existence of many consensus members   of the core mycobiome, and on unique patterns for individual subjects.   This research offered a cautionary note about unconditional acceptance   of lengthy lists of community members produced by automated assignments,   provided a roadmap for enhancing the likely biological relevance of   sequence-based fungal surveys, and built the foundation for   understanding the role of fungi in health and disease of the oral   cavity."
