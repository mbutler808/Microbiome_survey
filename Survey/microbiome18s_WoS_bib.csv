To investigate   relative abundance and diversity of airborne bacterial and fungal   communities, samples have been collected with a liquid impinger   (Coriolis mu) from the top of Mount Sonnblick (3106 m asl, Austrian   Alps) from the respective sources under a temporal aspect over four   seasons over the year to include all climatic conditions. Bacterial and   fungal samples (16S rRNA and ITS) were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq   paired-end sequencing, investigated for relative abundance by qPCR(16S   rRNA and 18S rRNA) and ice nucleation activity. Results show that there   is no stable free tropospheric air microbial community and air mass   origin was different for the four sampling periods which exerted   influence on the microbial composition of the atmosphere although a core   microbiome could be identified consisting of 61 bacterial OTUs and eight   fungal genera. Differentiation between seasons was stronger pronounced   in air than in precipitation, with rain being most different and   variable of precipitation types, indicating distinct forces driving   microbial fate in the air. Microorganisms precipitated with snow, hail   or rain or being transported by clouds differ in their species   composition from free tropospheric air masses and do not mirror the air   community structure. They were more diverse, distinct in composition,   16S:18S ratio and abundance from free-floating PBA. Hence, snow or cloud   samples are not suitable proxies for free tropospheric air microbiome   composition, since separation processes in aerosolization, transport and   scavenging occur. The microbial composition of arriving precipitation or   clouds represents only a part of the microbial air composition   communities of the cumulative sources of origin. Relative abundance and   composition of ice nucleation-active bacteria showed a higher share of   relative \% reads of known ice nucleation-active bacteria present in all   wet phases compared to air. Results propose a separation of IN-active   reads with higher shares occurring in precipitation. This study presents   the first comparison of free tropospheric bacterial and fungal abundance   and diversity in time series of air over several seasons in contrast to   various precipitation forms in the free troposphere."

Here we examine   microbial (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) community changes associated with   the surface low salinity layer (LSL) and underlying seawater in multiple   fjords in Fiordland National Park (New Zealand). High rainfall   (1200-8000 mm annually) and linked runoff from native forested   catchments results in surface LSLs with high tannin concentrations   within each fjord. These gradients are expected to drive changes in   microbial communities. We used amplicon sequencing (16S and 18S) to   assess the impact of these gradients on microbial communities and   identified depth linked changes in diversity and community structure.   With increasing depth, we observed significant increases in   Proteobacteria (15\%) and SAR (37\%), decreases in Opisthokonta (35\%),   and transiently increased Bacteroidetes (3\% increase from 0 to 40 m,   decreasing by 8\% at 200 m). Community structure differences were   observed along a transect from the head to the mouth, specifically 25\%   mean relative abundance decreases in Opisthokonta and Bacteroidetes, and   increases in SAR (25\%) and Proteobacteria (>5\%) at the surface,   indicating changes based on distance from the ocean. This provides the   first in-depth view into the ecological drivers of microbial communities   within New Zealand fjords. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Here, we used metatranscriptomics to   assess possible effects of moderately elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on grassland   rhizosphere microbiomes at the Giessen free-air CO2 enrichment (GiFACE)   site in August of 2015 and 2017. Since its launch in 1998, the GiFACE   atmospheric CO2 concentration has been maintained at 20\% higher than   ambient air levels, thereby suggesting a realistic ecosystem response to   eCO(2). Metatranscriptomics revealed significant eCO(2) effects on the   composition and activity of the grassland microbiomes in 2015, but not   in 2017. The summer of 2015 was characterized by prolonged heat waves,   while the summer temperature in 2017 was close to the long-term average.   In August 2015, rRNA and mRNA abundances of Eukarya relative to Bacteria   were significantly decreased in eCO(2) plots, in both rhizosphere soil   and root-associated microbiomes. On SSU rRNA level, the significant   increase in bacterial abundance was primarily related to an enrichment   of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and, most pronounced, a decline in   Fungi. In addition, we observed an enrichment of Acidobacteria,   Bacteroidetes, Chlorofiexi, and Planctomycetes and, among Eukarya, a   decline in Amoebozoa, SAR group, and Metazoa. The decrease in soil   fungal activity was confirmed by RT-qPCR of 18S rRNA; in good agreement   with a significant decrease in fungal mRNA involved in oxidative   phosphorylation (rhizosphere soil), and in folding, sorting and   degradation (root-associated). Among Fungi, the relative abundance of   most groups (e.g., Agaricomycetes [soil) and Leotiomycetes [roots])   decreased, but that of the Glonteromycetes (both compartments)   increased. Functional analysis of root mRNA suggests that the production   of plant secondary metabolites was increased in the summer of 2015.   These may have acted as an effective combat strategy against   phytopathogenic fungi, such as Leotiomycetes. In conclusion, our   metatranscriptomic study suggests that a near-future level of eCO(2)   combined with prolonged heat waves may have a significant impact on the   interactome between rhizosphere microbiomes and plant roots in European   grassland; with a primary effect on fungal activity."

Interactions between toxic cyanobacteria and aquatic   microorganisms need to be critically evaluated to understand microbial   drivers and modulators of the blooms. In this study, we applied 16S/18S   rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics analyses to measure the microbial   community composition and metabolic responses of the cyanobacterium   Microcystis aeruginosa in a coculture system receiving dissolved   inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIP) close to representative   concentrations in Lake Taihu, China. M. aeruginosa secreted alkaline   phosphatase using a DIP source produced by moribund and decaying   microorganisms when the P source was insufficient. During this process,   M. aeruginosa accumulated several intermediates in energy metabolism   pathways to provide energy for sustained high growth rates and increased   intracellular sugars to enhance its competitive capacity and ability to   defend itself against microbial attack. It also produced a variety of   toxic substances, including microcystins, to inhibit metabolite   formation via energy metabolism pathways of aquatic microorganisms,   leading to a negative effect on bacterial and eukaryotic microbial   richness and diversity. Overall, compared with the monoculture system,   the growth of M. aeruginosa was accelerated in coculture, while the   growth of some cooccurring microorganisms was inhibited, with the   diversity and richness of eukaryotic microorganisms being more   negatively impacted than those of prokaryotic microorganisms. These   findings provide valuable information for clarifying how M. aeruginosa   can potentially modulate its associations with other microorganisms,   with ramifications for its dominance in aquatic ecosystems.   IMPORTANCE We measured the microbial community composition and metabolic   responses of Microcystis aeruginosa in a microcosm coculture system   receiving dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIP) close to the   average concentrations in Lake Taihu. In the coculture system, DIP is   depleted and the growth and production of aquatic microorganisms can be   stressed by a lack of DIP availability. M. aeruginosa could accelerate   its growth via interactions with specific cooccurring microorganisms and   the accumulation of several intermediates in energy metabolism-related   pathways. Furthermore, M. aeruginosa can decrease the carbohydrate   metabolism of cooccurring aquatic microorganisms and thus disrupt   microbial activities in the coculture. This also had a negative effect   on bacterial and eukaryotic microbial richness and diversity.   Microcystin was capable of decreasing the biomass of total phytoplankton   in aquatic microcosms. Overall, compared to the monoculture, the growth   of total aquatic microorganisms is inhibited, with the diversity and   richness of eukaryotic microorganisms being more negatively impacted   than those of prokaryotic microorganisms. The only exception is M.   aeruginosa in the coculture system, whose growth was accelerated."

The primary processing of Houpo requires sweating treatment,   which is a special drying process and is considered to be an essential   embodiment of high quality and genuine medicinal materials. The sweating   of Houpo leads to peculiar changes in the microbial community structure   and the content of main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin   and magnoflorine). Variation in the microbial community was considered   the cause of the change in content of active substances of Houpo,   although the microbial taxa responsible for the improvement of content   remain unidentified. Methods In this study, we used MiSeq   high-throughput sequencing methods for partial bacterial 16S rRNA and   18S rRNA gene sequences to compare the bacterial and fungal community   structures at different timepoints in the process of sweating. The   content of the main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and   magnoflorine) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography   analysis to evaluate the effects of sweating. UPLC-Q-Extractive Orbitrap   mass spectrometry (UPLC-QE Orbitrap MS) was used to detection of   differential metabolites of unsweated Houpo before and after co-culture   with core bacterial solutions. Results In this study, the total contents   of magnolol (MG) and honokiol (HK) were significantly increased at 4 dp   (dp for day PM sample), up to 3.75\%, and the contents of syringin (SG)   and magnoflorine (MF) were as high as 0.12\% and 0.06\%, respectively.   Bacterial abundance and diversity were higher in the early stage (0   day-2 da; da for day AM sample) than in the later stage (4-5 dp), while   fungal abundance was more obvious in the later stage than in the early   stage. Positive correlation coefficients revealed that the relative   abundance of Enterobacter (P < 0.05), Klebsiella (P < 0.05), Weissella   (P < 0.05), Bacillus (P < 0.05) and Candida (P < 0.05) would be   conducive to improving the quality of Houpo. Negative correlation   coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of Actinomycetospora,   Singulisphaera, Mucilaginibacter, Deinococcus, Gemmatirosa,   Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Hymenobacter, Halomonas and   Capnobotryella could be a potential antagonist for the decrease in the   quality of Houpo. After co-culture of single core strain and unsweated   Houpo, there was no significant difference in the four main active   components, but there were other metabolites with significant   difference. Conclusions Our findings reveal that sweating increased the   content of the main active compounds, promoted the relative abundance of   potentially beneficial microbes, decreased the abundance of potentially   harmful microbes, the core functional genera group together, forming a   core microbiome, these genera are dominant across the different stages   of the sweating process and contribute to the quality development of the   characteristics of Houpo. Meanwhile, this study presented a clear scope   for potential beneficial microbes that improve the quality of Houpo."

Both mechanisms are likely to translate into   particular potato microbiome profiles, but the relative importance of   each is not known. Here, microbiomes of bulk and tuberosphere soil and   of potato periderm were studied in one resistant and one susceptible   cultivar grown in a conducive and a suppressive field. Disease severity   was suppressed similarly by both means yet, the copy numbers of txtB   gene (coding for a pathogenicity determinant) were similar in both soils   but higher in periderms of the susceptible cultivar from conducive soil.   Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes for bacteria (completed by 16S   rRNA microarray approach) and archaea, and of 18S rRNA genes for   micro-eukarytes showed that in bacteria, the more important was the   effect of cultivar and diversity decreased from resistant cultivar to   bulk soil to susceptible cultivar. The major changes occurred in   proportions of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria. In   archaea and micro-eukaryotes, differences were primarily due to the   suppressive and conducive soil. The effect of soil suppressiveness x   cultivar resistance depended on the microbial community considered, but   differed also with respect to soil and plant nutrient contents   particularly in N, S and Fe."

The aim was to reconstruct the history   of the storage of each single statue, to infer the possible relationship   among them, and to elucidate their geographical shift. A genetic   strategy, comprising metagenomic analyses of the 16S ribosomal DNA   (rDNA) of prokaryotes, 18S rDNA of eukaryotes, as well as internal   transcribed spacer regions of fungi, was performed by using the Ion   Torrent sequencing platform. Results suggest a possible common history   of storage of the two human torsi; their eukaryotic microbiomes showed   similarities comprising many soil-inhabiting organisms, which may   indicate storage or burial in land of agricultural soil. For the male   torso, it was possible to infer the geographical origin, due to the   presence of DNA traces of Taiwania, a tree found only in Asia. The small   head displayed differences concerning the eukaryotic community, compared   with the other two samples, but showed intriguing similarities with the   female torso concerning the bacterial community. Both displayed many   halotolerant and halophilic bacteria, which may indicate a longer stay   in arid and semi-arid surroundings as well as marine environments. The   microbiomes retrieved from each statue showed to be very specific, but   some individual members showed to be biological markers for the   geographical regions through which the pieces traveled and for the   conditions under which they were stored."

VL is a serious public health problem in   rural India, causing high morbidity and mortality, as well as major   costs to local and national health budgets. People at risk of VL are   also at risk of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil   transmitted helminths (worms). Intestinal worms are potent regulators of   host immune responses often mediated through cross-talk with gut   bacteria. Here we have used a modern DNA sequencing approach to   determine the composition of microbiota in stool samples from VL cases   and endemic controls. This allows us to determine all bacteria, as well   as all single-celled and multicellular organisms, that comprise the   microorganisms in the gut in a single sequencing experiment from a   single stool sample. In addition to providing valuable information   concerning commensal and pathogenic gut micro-organisms prevalent in   this region of India, we find some specific associations between   single-celled gut pathogens and VL case status.   Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani remains of   public health concern in rural India. Those at risk of VL are also at   risk of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil   transmitted helminths. Intestinal helminths are potent regulators of   host immune responses sometimes mediated through cross-talk with gut   microbiota. We evaluate a meta-taxonomic approach to determine the   composition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gut microflora using   amplicon-based sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and 18S rRNA   gene regions. The most abundant bacterial taxa identified in faecal   samples from Bihar State India were Prevotella (37.1\%),   Faecalibacterium (11.3\%), Escherichia-Shigella (9.1\%), Alloprevotella   (4.5\%), Bacteroides (4.1\%), Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 (1.6\%), and   Bifidobacterium (1.5\%). Eukaryotic taxa identified (excluding plant   genera) included Blastocystis (57.9\%; Order: Stramenopiles),   Dientamoeba (12.1\%; Family: Tritrichomonadea), Pentatrichomonas   (10.1\%; Family: Trichomonodea), Entamoeba (3.5\%; Family: Entamoebida),   Ascaridida (0.8\%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with Ascaris by   microscopy), Rhabditida (0.8\%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with   Strongyloides), and Cyclophyllidea (0.2\%; Order: Eucestoda; concordant   with Hymenolepis). Overall alpha (Shannon's, Faith's and Pielou's   indices) and beta (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity statistic; weighted UniFrac   distances) diversity of taxa did not differ significantly by age, sex,   geographic subdistrict, or VL case (N = 23) versus endemic control (EC;   N = 23) status. However, taxon-specific associations occurred: (i)   Ruminococcaceae UCG- 014 and Gastranaerophilales\_uncultured bacterium   were enriched in EC compared to VL cases; (ii) Pentatrichomonas was more   abundant in VL cases than in EC, whereas the reverse occurred for   Entamoeba. Across the cohort, high Escherichia-Shigella was associated   with reduced bacterial diversity, while high Blastocystis was associated   with high bacterial diversity and low Escherichia-Shigella. Individuals   with high Blastocystis had low Bacteroidaceae and high Clostridiales   vadin BB60 whereas the reverse held true for low Blastocystis.

Proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance   at both sampling sites and plant sizes, and Ascomycota was the most   abundant fungal phylum. At the order level, Acidobacteriales,   Actinomycetales, Burkholderiales, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales   represented the bacterial core microbiome of A. nordmanniana,   independently of the sampling site or plant size, while the fungal core   microbiome included members of the Agaricales, Hypocreales, and   Pezizales. Principal Coordinate Analysis indicated that both bacterial   and fungal communities clustered according to the sampling site pointing   to the significance of soil characteristics and climatic conditions for   the composition of root-associated microbial communities. Major   differences between communities from tall and small plants were a   dominance of the potential pathogen Fusarium (Hypocreales) in the small   plants from Germany, while Agaricales, that includes reported beneficial   ectomycorrhizal fungi, dominated in the tall plants. An evaluation of   plant root antioxidative enzyme profiles showed higher levels of the   antioxidative enzymes ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, and superoxide   dismutase in small plants compared to tall plants. We suggest that the   higher antioxidative enzyme activities combined with the growth arrest   phenotype indicate higher oxidative stress levels in the small plants.   Additionally, the correlations between the relative abundances of   specific taxa of the microbiome with the plant antioxidative enzyme   profiles were established. The main result was that many more bacterial   taxa correlated positively than negatively with one or more   antioxidative enzyme activity. This may suggest that the ability of   bacteria to increase plant antioxidative enzyme defenses is widespread."

While measures to minimize public health risks are in place,   the general microbial and protist community structure and dynamics in   these systems remain largely elusive. In this study, we analysed the   microbiome of the bulk water from the basins of three cooling towers by   16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing over the course of one year.   Bacterial diversity in all three towers was broadly comparable to other   freshwater systems, yet less diverse than natural environments; the most   abundant taxa are also frequently found in freshwater or drinking water.   While each cooling tower had a pronounced site-specific microbial   community, taxa shared among all locations mainly included groups   generally associated with biofilm formation. We also detected several   groups related to known opportunistic pathogens, such as Legionella,   Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas species, albeit at generally low   abundance. Although cooling towers represent a rather stable   environment, microbial community composition was highly dynamic and   subject to seasonal change. Protists are important members of the   cooling tower water microbiome and known reservoirs for bacterial   pathogens. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and protist taxa   successfully captured known interactions between amoeba-associated   bacteria and their hosts, and predicted a large number of additional   relationships involving ciliates and other protists. Together, this   study provides an unbiased and comprehensive overview of microbial   diversity of cooling tower water basins, establishing a framework for   investigating and assessing public health risks associated with these   man-made freshwater environments.

As a result, when host-associated microbial eukaryotes are   analysed by metabarcoding, the reads tend to be dominated by host   sequences. We have done an in silico validation against the SILVA 18S   rRNA database of a non-metazoan primer set (primers that are biased   against the metazoan 18S rRNA) that recovers only 2.6\% of all the   metazoan sequences, while recovering most of the other eukaryotes   (80.4\%). Among metazoans, the non-metazoan primers are predicted to   amplify 74\% of Porifera sequences, 4\% of Ctenophora, and 15\% of   Cnidaria, while amplifying almost no sequences within Bilateria. In   vivo, these non-metazoan primers reduce significantly the animal signal   from coral and human samples, and when compared against universal   primers provide at worst a 2-fold decrease in the number of metazoan   reads and at best a 2800-fold decrease.

The microbiome analysis was performed using 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing   with the miSeq instrument. Inflammatory activity was assessed by faecal   calprotectin. Data regarding medical treatment and surgery in the year   after faecal sampling were collected from patient charts. Results: One   hundred and forty-three (143) paediatric IBD patients and 34 healthy   controls (HC) were included. We found a reduced richness in IBD patients   compared to HCs (controls vs. ulcerative colitis (UC), p < .001 and   controls vs. Crohn's disease (CD), p = .04)). Moreover, a high degree of   intestinal inflammation and extensive disease extent was associated with   reduced richness in UC (p = .02 and p = .04, respectively). Nine species   were significantly associated with a healthy microbiome and three   species were associated with IBD. Lastly, we found that the composition   of the microbiome could distinguish between CD, UC and HCs. Conclusions:   In this study, we found that the microbiome could discriminate between   IBD phenotypes and predict which patients were at risk of surgery.

Here, we surveyed the prevalence and subtype variation of   Blastocystis in faecal samples collected as part of the Flemish Gut   Flora Project (FGFP), a Western population cohort. We assessed potential   links between Blastocystis subtypes and identified microbiota-host   covariates and quantified microbiota differentiation relative to subtype   abundances.   Design We profiled stool samples from 616 healthy individuals from the   FGFP cohort as well as 107 patients with IBD using amplicon sequencing   targeting the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. We   evaluated associations of Blastocystis, and their subtypes, with host   parameters, diversity and composition of bacterial and archaeal   communities.   Results Blastocystis prevalence in the non-clinical population cohort   was 30\% compared with 4\% among Flemish patients with IBD. Within the   FGFP cohort, out of 69 previously identified gut microbiota covariates,   only age was associated with Blastocystis subtype carrier status. In   contrast, a strong association between microbiota community composition   and Blastocystis subtypes was observed, with effect sizes larger than   that of host covariates. Microbial richness and diversity were linked to   both Blastocystis prevalence and subtype variation. All Blastocystis   subtypes detected in this cohort were found to be less prevalent in   Bacteroides enterotyped samples. Interestingly, Blastocystis subtypes 3   and 4 were inversely correlated with Akkermansia, suggesting   differential associations of subtypes with host health.   Conclusions These results emphasise the role of Blastocystis as a common   constituent of the healthy gut microbiota. We show its prevalence is   reduced in patients with active IBD and demonstrate that subtype   characterisation is essential for assessing the relationship between   Blastocystis, microbiota profile and host health. These findings have   direct clinical applications, especially in donor selection for faecal   transplantation."

In particular, limited information is   available on the effects of metals on scleractinian corals which are   foundation species that form vital structural habitats supporting other   biota. This study investigated the effects of dissolved nickel and   copper on the coral Acropora muricata and its associated microbiota.   Corals collected from the Great Barrier Reef were exposed to dissolved   nickel (45, 90, 470, 900 and 9050 mu g Ni/L) or copper (4, 11, 32 and 65   mu g Cu/L) in flow through chambers at the National Sea Simulator,   Townsville, Qld, Australia. After a 96-h exposure DNA metabarcoding (16S   rDNA and 185 rDNA) was undertaken on all samples to detect changes in   the structure of the coral microbiome. The controls remained healthy   throughout the study period. After 36 h, bleaching was only observed in   corals exposed to 32 and 65 mu g Cu/L and very high nickel   concentrations (9050 mu g Ni/L). At 96 h, significant discolouration of   corals was only observed in 470 and 900 mu g Ni/L treatments, the   highest concentrations tested. While high concentrations of nickel   caused bleaching, no changes in the composition of their microbiome   communities were observed. In contrast, exposure to copper not only   resulted in bleaching, but altered the composition of both the eukaryote   and bacterial communities of the coral's microbiomes. Our findings   showed that these effects were only evident at relatively high   concentrations of nickel and copper, reflecting concentrations observed   only in extremely polluted environments. Elevated metal concentrations   have the capacity to alter the microbiomes which are inherently linked   to coral health. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All   rights reserved."

Vertebrates usually become   L-ascorbate auxothrophs when the last enzyme of the synthetic pathway,   an L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), is lost. Since Protostomes were until   recently thought not to have a GULO gene, they were considered to be   auxothrophs for Vitamin C.ResultsBy performing phylogenetic analyses   with tens of non-Bilateria and Protostomian genomes, it is shown, that a   GULO gene is present in the non-Bilateria Placozoa, Myxozoa (here   reported for the first time) and Anthozoa groups, and in Protostomians,   in the Araneae family, the Gastropoda class, the Acari subclass (here   reported for the first time), and the Priapulida, Annelida (here   reported for the first time) and Brachiopoda phyla lineages. GULO is an   old gene that predates the separation of Animals and Fungi, although it   could be much older. We also show that within Protostomes, GULO has been   lost multiple times in large taxonomic groups, namely the Pancrustacea,   Nematoda, Platyhelminthes and Bivalvia groups, a pattern similar to that   reported for Vertebrate species. Nevertheless, we show that Drosophila   melanogaster seems to be capable of synthesizing L-ascorbate, likely   through an alternative pathway, as recently reported for Caenorhabditis   elegans.ConclusionsNon-Bilaterian and Protostomians seem to be able to   synthesize Vitamin C either through the conventional animal pathway or   an alternative pathway, but in this animal group, not being able to   synthesize L-ascorbate seems to be the exception rather than the rule."

Previous studies have shown that starter   feeding can effectively facilitate the growth and development of the   rumen in ruminants. However, the mechanism through which starter feeding   stimulates the development of the rumen is not clear. Here, we performed   an integrated analysis in ruminal microbiota and a host transcriptomic   profile in a lamb model with the intervention of starter feed to   understand the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk in stimulating the   development of the ruminal epithelium.ResultsDecreased ruminal pH and   increased acetate and butyrate concentrations in the rumen, followed by   increasing rumen organ index, were observed in lambs supplemented with   starter. Using metagenome sequencing in combination with 16S rRNA and   18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the results showed the abundance of   acetate-producing Mitsuokella spp., lactate-producing Sharpea spp.,   lactate-utilizing Megasphaera spp., and Entodinium spp. was enriched in   rumen microbial communities in the starter-feed group. The abundances of   genes involved in sugar degradation were decreased in starter-feed   lambs, but the GH13 encoding -amylase was obviously increased. Rumen   epithelial transcriptome analysis revealed that seven differentially   expressed genes, including MAPK1, PIK3CB, TNFSF10, ITGA6, SNAI2, SAV1,   and DLG, related to the cell growth module were upregulated, and BAD's   promotion of cell death was downregulated. Correlation analysis revealed   that the increase in the concentrations of acetate and butyrate   significantly correlated with the expression of these genes, which   indicates acetate and butyrate likely acted as important drivers in the   ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk.ConclusionsThe present study   comprehensively describes the symbiotic relationship between the rumen   microbiota and the host in lambs after starter feeding. Our data   demonstrates that the microbiome-driven generation of acetate and   butyrate mediated the growth-related genes' regulation of the   growth-associated signalling pathway in the ruminal epithelium. These   co-development networks regulated many physiological processes in the   epithelium, including papillae morphology and rumen epithelial growth."

Past work suggests adult mosquitoes can detect   certain microbes that stimulate oviposition. The presence or absence of   certain microbes in water containers thus can attract or repel mosquito   species to different containers. I hypothesized that these relationships   could be detected via metagenomics. I focused on two container breeders   that coexist in Southern Taiwan: the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the   less competent vector Ae. albopictus. In addition to culturing, I   performed 16S and 18S rDNA metagenomics assays, the latter of which had   never been applied to mosquito waters before, to identify the microbial   diversity of artificial containers with and without mosquito larvae. I   found no correlation between mosquito presence to any features of the   containers or to their microbiomes, which instead correlated strongly   with location. Microbial diversity across containers was highly   variable, even within the same location, with multiple taxa only found   in single containers. This variability is reasonable, because mosquito   gut microbiomes are also extremely variable. The possibility remains   that microbes in natural containers differ significantly from those in   artificial containers, and that these differences drive Aedes   preferences for human-associated containers. Broad, single-microbe   experimental work is recommended to identify possible attractant or   repellent microbial taxa."

It is still unknown how   trace amounts of CIP affect the aquatic microbial community diversity   and function. We therefore investigated the effects of CIP on the   structure and function of freshwater microbial communities via 16S/18S   rRNA gene sequencing and metatranscriptomic analyses. CIP treatment (7   mu g/L) did not significantly alter the physical and chemical condition   of the water body as well as the composition of the main species in the   community, but slightly increased the relative abundance of   cyanobacteria and decreased the relative abundance of eukaryotes.   Metatranscriptomic results showed that bacteria enhanced their   phosphorus transport and photosynthesis after CIP exposure. The   replication, transcription, translation and cell proliferation were all   suppressed in eukaryotes, while the bacteria were not affected in any of   these aspects. This interesting phenomenon was the exact opposite to   both the antibacterial property of CIP and its safety for eukaryotes. We   hypothesize that reciprocal and antagonistic interactions in the   microcosm both contribute to this result: cyanobacteria may enhance   their tolerance to CIP through benefiting from cross-feeding and some   secreted substances that withstand bacterial CIP stress would also   affect eukaryotic growth. The present study thus indicates that a   detailed assessment of the aquatic ecotoxicity of CIP is essential, as   the effects of CIP are much more complicated in microbial communities   than in monocultures. CIP will continue to be an environmental   contaminant due to its wide usage and production and more attention   should be given to the negative effects of antibiotics as well as other   bioactive pollutants on aquatic environments."

This often leads to spurious correlations, making the interpretation of   relationships to biogeochemical rates challenging. To overcome this   issue, we quantitatively estimated the abundance of microorganisms by   spiking in known amounts of internal DNA standards. Using a 3-year   sample set of diverse microbial communities from the Western Antarctica   Peninsula, we demonstrated that the internal standard method yielded   community profiles and taxon cooccurrence patterns substantially   different from those derived using relative abundances. We found that   the method provided results consistent with the traditional CHEMTAX   analysis of pigments and total bacterial counts by flow cytometry. Using   the internal standard method, we also showed that chloroplast 16S rRNA   gene data in microbial surveys can be used to estimate abundances of   certain eukaryotic phototrophs such as cryptophytes and diatoms. In   Phaeocystis, scatter in the 16S/18S rRNA gene ratio may be explained by   physiological adaptation to environmental conditions. We conclude that   the internal standard method, when applied to rRNA gene microbial   community profiling, is quantitative and that its application will   substantially improve our understanding of microbial ecosystems.   IMPORTANCE High-throughput-sequencing-based marine microbiome profiling   is rapidly expanding and changing how we study the oceans. Although   powerful, the technique is not fully quantitative; it provides taxon   counts only in relative abundances. In order to address this issue, we   present a method to quantitatively estimate microbial abundances per   unit volume of seawater filtered by spiking known amounts of internal   DNA standards into each sample. We validated this method by comparing   the calculated abundances to other independent estimates, including   chemical markers (pigments) and total bacterial cell counts by flow   cytometry. The internal standard approach allows us to quantitatively   estimate and compare marine microbial community profiles, with important   implications for linking environmental microbiomes to quantitative   processes such as metabolic and biogeochemical rates."

The pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea supplements nutrient   acquisition through carnivory, capturing insect prey which are digested   by a food web community of eukaryotes and bacteria. While the food web   invertebrates are well studied, and some recent studies have   characterized bacteria, detailed genetic analysis of eukaryotic   diversity is lacking. This study aimed to compare eukaryotic and   bacterial composition and diversity of pitcher communities within and   between populations of host plants in nearby but distinct wetland   habitats, and to characterize microbial functions across populations and   in comparison with another freshwater community.   Methods. Pitcher fluid was sampled from the two wetlands, Cedarburg and   Sapa Bogs, community DNA was extracted, and 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons   were sequenced and data processed for community-level comparisons.   Results and Conclusions. Bacterial diversity in the small pitcher volume   rivaled that of larger aquatic communities. Between pitcher plant   populations, several bacterial families (Kiloniellaceae,   Acetobacteraceae, Xanthobacteraceae, Sanguibacteraceae, Oligoflexaceae,   Nitrosomonadaceae, Chromatiaceae, Saprospiraceae) were significantly   higher in one population. However, although predicted pitcher bacterial   functions were distinct from other freshwater communities, especially   for some amino acid metabolism, functions were similar across all the   pitchers in the two populations. This suggests some functional   redundancy among bacterial taxa, and that functions converge to achieve   similar food web processes. The sequencing identified a previously   under-appreciated high diversity of ciliates, Acari mites, fungi and   flagellates in pitcher communities; the most abundant sequences from   eukaryotic taxa were Oligohymenophorea ciliates, millipedes and   Ichthyosporea flagellates. Two thirds of taxa were identified as food   web inhabitants and less than one third as prey organisms. Although   eukaryotic composition was not significantly different between   populations, there were different species of core taxonomic groups   present in different pitchers-these differences may be driven by wetland   habitats providing different populations to colonize new pitchers.   Eukaryotic composition was more variable than bacterial composition, and   there was a poor relationship between bacterial and eukaryotic   composition within individual pitchers, suggesting that colonization by   eukaryotes may be more stochastic than for bacteria, and bacterial   recruitment to pitchers may involve factors other than prey capture and   colonization by eukaryotic food web inhabitants."

In   contrast, diversity patterns of most other organisms remain elusive,   although some of them, for instance microorganisms, constitute the   overwhelming majority of taxa in any given location, both in terms of   diversity and abundance. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding to estimate   prokaryote and eukaryote diversity in environmental soil and litter   samples from 39 survey plots in a longitudinal transect across Brazilian   Amazonia using 16S and 18S gene sequences, respectively.

Our results 1) provide a first large-scale mapping of   Amazonian soil biodiversity, suggesting that OTU richness patterns might   follow substantially different patterns from those observed for   macro-organisms; and 2) indicate that locality and habitat factors   interact in determining OTU richness patterns and community composition.

Candida lysate with C. difficile increased IL-8   production from HT-29 and Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cell-lines.   Bifidobacterium attenuated the disease severity of the C. difficile plus   Candida model. The reduced severity was associated with decreased   Candida burdens in feces. In conclusion, gut C. albicans worsened C.   difficile infection, possibly through exacerbation of inflammation.   Hence, a mouse model of Clostridium difficile infection with C. albicans   present in the gut may better model the human patient condition. Gut   fungal mycobiome investigation in patients with C. difficile is   warranted and may suggest therapeutic targets."

These strains were specifically isolated   from the rhizosphere of Panax ginseng (Korean ginseng). The siderophore   production of isolated fungi was investigated with chrome azurol S (CAS)   assay liquid media amended with different concentrations of Zn2+ (50 to   250 mu g/ml). The percentage of siderophore units was quantified using   the ultra-violet (UV) irradiation method. The results indicated that   high concentrations of Zn2+ ion increase the production of siderophore   in iron-limited cultures. Maximum siderophore production by the fungal   strains was detected at Zn2+ ion concentration of 150 mu g/ml except for   Mortierella sp., which had the highest siderophore production at 200 mu   g/ml. One potent siderophore-producing strain (Penicillium sp. JJHO) was   strongly influenced by the presence of Zn2+ ions and showed high   identity to P. commune (100\% using 18S-rRNA sequencing).

While studies have shown fungal communities to be significant   modulators of human health, information on the prevalence of taxa such   as protozoa and helminths has been limited to a small number of species   for which targeted molecular diagnostics are available. To probe the   diversity of eukaryotic microbes and their relationships with other   members of the microbiota, we applied in silico and experimental   approaches to design a novel two-amplicon surveillance tool, based on   sequencing regions of ribosomal RNA genes and their internal transcribed   spacers. We subsequently demonstrated the utility of our approach by   characterizing the eukaryotic microbiota of 46 hospitalized Malawian   children suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM).ResultsThrough   in silico analysis and validation on a diverse panel of eukaryotes, we   identified 18S rRNA variable genetic regions 4 and 5 (18S V4V5),   together with a region encoding 28S rRNA variable genetic region 2 and   the internal transcribed spacers (transITS), as optimal for the   systematic classification of eukaryotes. Sequencing of these regions   revealed protozoa in all stool samples from children with SAM and   helminths in most, including several eukaryotes previously implicated in   malnutrition and diarrheal disease. Clinical comparisons revealed no   association between protozoan parasites and diarrhea or HIV reactivity.   However, the presence of Blastocystis correlated with bacterial alpha   diversity and increased abundance of specific taxa, including   Sporobacter, Cellulosibacter, Oscillibacter, and Roseburia.ConclusionWe   suggest this novel two-ampliconbased strategy will prove an effective   tool to deliver new insights into the role of eukaryotic microbiota in   health and disease."

Using   Next-Generation sequencing of the 18S rDNA internal transcribed spacer   (ITS1) region, we examined outcomes of enduring oil exposure on   aboveground leaf and belowground endophytic root and rhizosphere fungal   communities of Spartina alterniflora, a highly valued ecosystem engineer   in southeastern Louisiana marshes affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon   accident. We found that aboveground foliar fungal communities exhibited   site-dependent compositional turnover with consequent loss in diversity   according to oiling history. Rhizosphere soil communities also exhibited   shifts in community composition associated with oiling history, whereas   root endophytic communities did not. Oiling did not increase or decrease   similarities among aboveground and belowground communities within an   individual host, indicating that host plant characteristics exert   stronger control than external factors on fungal community composition.   These results show that fungal community responses to oiling vary within   tissues of the same host plant, and that differences in the local   environment, or alternatively, site-specific differences in residual oil   constrain the magnitude of exposure responses. Our study offers novel   perspectives on how environmental contaminants and perturbations can   influence plant microbiomes, highlighting the importance of assessing   long-term ecological outcomes of oil pollution to better understand how   shifts in microbial communities influence plant performance and   ecosystem function.

Given the   diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology   of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information on the dynamics of   the parasite, vector, the gut micro biome of the vector, and the blood   meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated   with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a   RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from   T. dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across   spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned   from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions   of Central America. Information from each biotic source was   distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to evaluate the   prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing Units   (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata,   gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 3.25   million reads per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1\%   assigned to the parasite, 20\% to the vector, 11\% to bacteria, and 4\%   to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we   detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: Tcl and a   second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were   sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of   25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were sufficient to   detect geographic genetic structure at both local and regional scales.   We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher   bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those   that were not infected.

Mixed mock community analyses revealed marked variability in   the ability of each primer pair to accurately characterize a complex   community. ITS target regions outperformed LSU and SSU. Of the ITS   regions, ITS1 failed to generate sequences for Yarrowia lipolytica and   all three Malassezia species when in a mixed community. These findings   were further supported in studies of human sinonasal and mouse fecal   samples. Based on these analyses, previous studies using ITS1, SSU, or   LSU markers may omit key taxa that are identified by the ITS2 marker. Of   methods commonly used in human mycobiota studies to date, we recommend   selection of the ITS2 marker. Further investigation of more recently   developed fungal primer options will be essential to ultimately   determine the optimal methodological approach by which future human   mycobiota studies ought to be standardized."

However,   the relationship between the microbial communities of the cockroach gut   and feces is poorly understood. We analyzed the V4 region of the 16S   rRNA gene and the V9 region of the 18S rRNA gene by next-generation   sequencing (NGS) to compare the bacterial and protist diversities in   guts versus feces and males versus females, as well as assess variation   across cockroach populations. Cockroaches harbored a diverse array of   bacteria, and 80 to 90\% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were   shared between the feces and gut. Lab-reared and field-collected   cockroaches had distinct microbiota, and whereas lab-reared cockroaches   had relatively conserved communities, considerable variation was   observed in the microbial community composition of cockroaches collected   in different apartments. Nonetheless, cockroaches from all locations   shared some core bacterial taxa. The eukaryotic community in the feces   of field-collected cockroaches was found to be more diverse than that in   lab-reared cockroaches. These results demonstrate that cockroaches   disseminate their gut microbiome in their feces, and they underscore the   important contribution of the cockroach fecal microbiome to the   microbial diversity of cockroach-infested homes.   IMPORTANCE The German cockroach infests diverse human-built structures,   including homes and hospitals. It produces potent allergens that trigger   asthma and disseminates opportunistic pathogens in its feces. A   comprehensive understanding of gut and fecal microbial communities of   cockroaches is essential not only to understand their contribution to   the biology of the cockroach, but also for exploring their clinical   relevance. In this study, we compare the diversity of bacteria and   eukaryotes in the cockroach gut and feces and assess the variation in   the gut microbiota across cockroach populations."

We   collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and   physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from   Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial   community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique   trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, operational   taxonomic units (OTUs), and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we   observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the   transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri   River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the   historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL.

Recently, we identified a critical window early in the life of both mice   and Canadian infants during which gut microbial changes (dysbiosis)   affect asthma development. Given geographic differences in human gut   microbiota worldwide, we studied the effects of gut microbial dysbiosis   on atopic wheeze in a population living in a distinct developing world   environment.   Objective: We sought to determine whether microbial alterations in early   infancy are associated with the development of atopic wheeze in a   nonindustrialized setting.   Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested within a birth cohort   from rural Ecuador in which we identified 27 children with atopic wheeze   and 70 healthy control subjects at 5 years of age. We analyzed bacterial   and eukaryotic gut microbiota in stool samples collected at 3 months of   age using 16S and 18S sequencing. Bacterial metagenomes were predicted   from 16S rRNA data by using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by   Reconstruction of Unobserved States and categorized by function with   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ontology. Concentrations of   fecal short-chain fatty acids were determined by using gas   chromatography.   Results: As previously observed in Canadian infants, microbial dysbiosis   at 3 months of age was associated with later development of atopic   wheeze. However, the dysbiosis in Ecuadorian babies involved different   bacterial taxa, was more pronounced, and also involved several fungal   taxa. Predicted metagenomic analysis emphasized significant   dysbiosis-associated differences in genes involved in carbohydrate and   taurine metabolism. Levels of the fecal short-chain fatty acids acetate   and caproate were reduced and increased, respectively, in the 3-month   stool samples of children who went on to have atopic wheeze.   Conclusions: Our findings support the importance of fungal and bacterial   microbiota during the first 100 days of life on the development of   atopic wheeze and provide additional support for considering modulation   of the gut microbiome as a primary asthma prevention strategy."

This microbiota can thus be considered a toolbox enabling plants to   buffer local environmental changes, with a positive influence on plant   fitness. In this context, the transmission of the microbiota to the   progeny represent a way to ensure the presence of beneficial symbionts   within the habitat. Examples of such transmission have been mainly   described for seed transmission and concern a few pathogenic   microorganisms. We investigated the transmission of symbiotic partners   to plant progeny within clonal plant network.   Methods: We used the clonal plant Glechoma hederacea as plant model and   forced newly emitted clonal progeny to root in separated pots while   controlling the presence of microorganisms. We used an amplicon   sequencing approach of 16S and 18S rRNA targeting bacteria/archaea and   fungi respectively to describe the root microbiota of mother and   clonal-plant offspring.   Results: We demonstrated the vertical transmission of a significant   proportion of the mother plants' symbiotic bacteria and fungi to the   daughters. Interestingly, archaea were not transmitted to the daughter   plants. Transmitted communities had lower richness, suggesting a   filtration during transmission. We found that the transmitted pool of   microorganisms was similar among daughters, constituting the   heritability of a specific cohort of microorganisms, opening a new   understanding of the plant holobiont. We also found significant effects   of distance to the mother plant and of growth time on the richness of   the microbiota transmitted.   Conclusions: In this clonal plant, microorganisms are transmitted   between individuals through connections, thereby ensuring the   availability of microbe partners for the newborn plants as well as the   dispersion between hosts for the microorganisms. This previously   undescribed ecological process allows the dispersal of microorganisms in   space and across plant generations. As the vast majority of plants are   clonal, this process might be therefore a strong driver of ecosystem   functioning and assembly of plant and microorganism communities in a   wide range of ecosystems."

However, fine-scale analysis of   nematode microbiomes revealed a variety of novel ecological   interactions, including putative parasites and symbionts, and potential   associations with bacterial/archaeal taxa involved in nitrogen and   methane cycling. Our results suggest that in marine habitats,   free-living nematodes may utilize diverse and generalist foraging   strategies that are not correlated with host genotype or feeding   morphology.

However, many of the fungi most commonly detected   in stool samples are also present in food or the oral cavity. Therefore,   to recognize which gut fungi are likely to have a sustained influence on   human health, there is a need to separate transient members of the GI   tract from true colonizers. To identify colonizing fungi, the eukaryotic   rRNA operon's second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) was sequenced   from the stool, saliva, and food of healthy adults following consumption   of different controlled diets. Unlike most bacterial 16S rRNA genes, the   only fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in stool   DNA across multiple diets were also present in saliva and/or food.   Additional analyses, including culture-based approaches and sequencing   of the 18S rRNA gene, ITS2 cDNA, and DNA extracted using alternative   methods, failed to detect additional fungi. Two abundant fungi,   Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, were examined further in   healthy volunteers. Saccharomyces became undetectable in stool when a S.   cerevisiae-free diet was consumed, and the levels of C. albicans in   stool were dramatically reduced by more frequent cleaning of teeth.   Extremely low fungal abundance, the inability of fungi to grow under   conditions mimicking the distal gut, and evidence from analysis of other   public datasets further support the hypothesis that fungi do not   routinely colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults.   IMPORTANCE We sought to identify the fungi that colonize healthy GI   tracts and that have a sustained influence on the diverse functions of   the gut microbiome. Instead, we found that all fungi in the stool of   healthy volunteers could be explained by their presence in oral and   dietary sources and that our results, together with those from other   analyses, support the model that there is little or no gastrointestinal   colonization by fungi. This may be due to Westernization, primate   evolution, fungal ecology, and/or the strong defenses of a healthy   immune system. Importantly, fungal colonization of the GI tract may   often be indicative of disease. As fungi can cause serious infections in   immunocompromised individuals and are found at increased abundance in   multiple disorders of the GI tract, understanding normal fungal   colonization is essential for proper treatment and prevention of fungal   pathogenesis."

To provide such information, we acquired new   shotgun metagenomic sequence data for use with microscopy to focus on   prokaryotic and eukaryotic genera of a Peltigera ponojensis   microbiome.Methodology.16S, 23S, 18S, and 28S rDNA sequences filtered   from deep shotgun metagenomic Illumina and long-read Roche 454   metagenomic sequence data were employed with the SILVAngs analytic   pipeline to infer generic diversity, and lichen microbiota were imaged   with light and scanning electron microscopy.Pivotal results.Correlative   microscopy indicated the presence of morphologically diverse microbes on   upper and lower lichen surfaces, and putative bacteria were observed   within the photobiont zone. Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, and Nostoc   were the most abundant of similar to 50 relatively abundant bacterial   genera, those inferred to occur in 100 16S and/or 23S rDNA reads. More   than 140 additional prokaryotic genera were detected in 10 reads.   Sequences classifying with eukaryotic representatives of Rhizaria,   Amoebozoa, Alveolata, Metazoa, and Viridiplantae were detected in 10 18S   and/or 28S rDNA reads. The most abundant protist was the rhizarian   Protaspa (=Protaspis), indicated by >100 28S rDNA reads. More than 9000   18S rDNA reads classified with Peltigera and >1000 with Solorina; 10   additional ascomycete genera and two basidomycete genera were detected   at >10 reads.Conclusions.Molecular inference of a core of nonoxygenic   bacterial genera common to P. ponojensis and free-living Nostoc   microbiomes suggests that some functionally significant cyanolichen   microbiota may derive from those of ancestral free-living cyanobacteria,   possibly indicating an early step in the evolution of cyanolichen   microbiomes. A surprising diversity of microbiome eukaryotes suggested   that lichens may serve as a habitat for such organisms."

The   postmortem interval can lead to the identification of the deceased and   the validation of witness statements and suspect alibis. Recent research   has demonstrated that microbes provide an accurate clock that starts at   death and relies on ecological change in the microbial communities that   normally inhabit a body and its surrounding environment. Here, we   explore how to build the most robust Random Forest regression models for   prediction of PMI by testing models built on different sample types   (gravesoil, skin of the torso, skin of the head), gene markers (16S   ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer regions   (ITS)), and taxonomic levels (sequence variants, species, genus, etc.).   We also tested whether particular suites of indicator microbes were   informative across different datasets. Generally, results indicate that   the most accurate models for predicting PMI were built using gravesoil   and skin data using the 16S rRNA genetic marker at the taxonomic level   of phyla. Additionally, several phyla consistently contributed highly to   model accuracy and may be candidate indicators of PMI."

Differences in the   abundances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients.   It is, however, unknown whether these differences can be observed in   individuals at high risk, for example, with idiopathic rapid eye   movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of-synuclein   aggregation disorders including PD.   Objectives: To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and   stool samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep   behavior disorder, manifest PD, and healthy individuals.   Methods: Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76   PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder   patients, and 78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal   RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics,   clinical parameters including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing,   were analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and controlled   differential analyses were performed.   Results: Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia, were   observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty   percent of the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls   showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior   disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and   correlated with nonmotor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select   samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so far uncharacterized   differentially abundant organisms.   Conclusion: Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial   taxa in PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior   disorder in comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the   potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize microbial taxa,   which are enriched or depleted in PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye   movement sleep behavior disorder.

Their adaptive   success in such challenging environments is largely due to their gill   symbiotic association with chemosynthetic bacteria. We examined the   response of vent mussels as they adapt to sea-level environmental   conditions, through an assessment of the relative abundance of   host-symbiont related RNA transcripts to better understand how the gill   microbiome may drive host-symbiont interactions in vent mussels during   hypothetical venting inactivity. Results: The metatranscriptome of B.   azoricus was sequenced from gill tissues sampled at different   time-points during a five-week acclimatization experiment, using   Next-Generation-Sequencing.After Illumina sequencing, a total of   181,985,262 paired-end reads of 150 bp were generated with an average of   16,544,115 read per sample. Metatranscriptome analysis confirmed that   experimental acclimatization in aquaria accounted for global gill   transcript variation. Additionally, the analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA   sequences data allowed for a comprehensive characterization of   host-symbiont interactions, which included the gradual loss of gill   endosymbionts and signaling pathways, associated with stress responses   and energy metabolism, under experimental acclimatization. Dominant   active transcripts were assigned to the following KEGG categories:   ``Ribosome'', ``Oxidative phosphorylation'' and ``Chaperones and   folding catalysts'' suggesting specific metabolic responses to   physiological adaptations in aquarium environment. Conclusions: Gill   metagenomics analyses highlighted microbial diversity shifts and a clear   pattern of varying mRNA transcript abundancies and expression during   acclimatization to aquarium conditions which indicate change in   bacterial community activity. This approach holds potential for the   discovery of new host-symbiont associations, evidencing new functional   transcripts and a clearer picture of methane metabolism during loss of   endosymbionts. Towards the end of acclimatization, we observed trends in   three major functional subsystems, as evidenced by an increment of   transcripts related to genetic information processes; the decrease of   chaperone and folding catalysts and oxidative phosphorylation   transcripts; but no change in transcripts of gluconeogenesis and   co-factors-vitamins."

Here, we set out to test whether an ecological imprint   on the termite gut microbiome remains, when focusing on the persistent   microbiome. Therefore, we kept five termite species under strictly   controlled dietary conditions and subsequently profiled their protist   and bacterial gut microbial communities using 18S and 16S rRNA gene   amplicon sequencing. The species differed in their ecology; while three   of the investigated species were wood-dwellers that feed on the piece of   wood they live in and never leave except for the mating flight, the   other two species were foragers that regularly leave their nests to   forage for food. Despite these prominent ecological differences, protist   microbiome structure aligned with phylogenetic relatedness of termite   host species. Conversely, bacterial communities seemed more flexible,   suggesting that microbiome structure aligned more strongly with the   foraging and wood-dwelling ecologies. Interestingly, protist and   bacterial community alpha-diversity correlated, suggesting either   putative interactions between protists and bacteria, or that both types   of microbes in the termite gut follow shared structuring principles.

To date, human gut mycobiome   studies have primarily been disease centric or in small cohorts of   healthy individuals. To contribute to existing knowledge of the human   mycobiome, we investigated the gut mycobiome of the Human Microbiome   Project (HMP) cohort by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2   (ITS2) region as well as the 18S rRNA gene.   Results: Three hundred seventeen HMP stool samples were analyzed by ITS2   sequencing. Fecal fungal diversity was significantly lower in comparison   to bacterial diversity. Yeast dominated the samples, comprising eight of   the top 15 most abundant genera. Specifically, fungal communities were   characterized by a high prevalence of Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and   Candida, with S. cerevisiae, M. restricta, and C. albicans operational   taxonomic units (OTUs) present in 96. 8, 88.3, and 80.8\% of samples,   respectively. There was a high degree of inter-and intra-volunteer   variability in fungal communities. However, S. cerevisiae, M. restricta,   and C. albicans OTUs were found in 92.2, 78.3, and 63.6\% of volunteers,   respectively, in all samples donated over an approximately 1-year   period. Metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data agreed with ITS2   results; however, ITS2 sequencing provided greater resolution of the   relatively low abundance mycobiome constituents.   Conclusions: Compared to bacterial communities, the human gut mycobiome   is low in diversity and dominated by yeast including Saccharomyces,   Malassezia, and Candida. Both inter-and intra-volunteer variability in   the HMP cohort were high, revealing that unlike bacterial communities,   an individual's mycobiome is no more similar to itself over time than to   another person's. Nonetheless, several fungal species persisted across a   majority of samples, evidence that a core gut mycobiome may exist. ITS2   sequencing data provided greater resolution of the mycobiome membership   compared to metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data, suggesting   that it is a more sensitive method for studying the mycobiome of stool   samples."

Here, high-throughput amplicon sequencing of ribosomal   genes was used to quantify the dynamics of bacterial (16S) and   phytoplankton assemblages (18S) associated with blooms and cultures of   two harmful algae, Alexandrium fundyense and Dinophysis acuminata.   Experiments were performed to assess changes in natural bacterial and   phytoplankton communities in response to the filtrate from cultures of   these two harmful algae. Analysis of prokaryotic sequences from   ecosystems, experiments, and cultures revealed statistically unique   bacterial associations with each HAB. The dinoflagellate, Alexandrium,   was strongly associated with multiple genera of Flavobacteria including   Owenweeksia spp., Maribacter spp., and individuals within the NS5 marine   group. While Flavobacteria also dominated Dinophysis-associated   communities, the relative abundance of Alteromonadales bacteria strongly   co-varied with Dinophysis abundances during blooms and Ulvibacter spp.   (Flavobacteriales) and Arenicella spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) were   associated with cells in culture. Eukaryotic sequencing facilitated the   discovery of the endosymbiotic, parasitic dinoflagellate, Amoebophrya   spp., that had not been regionally described but represented up to 17\%   of sequences during Alexandrium blooms. The presence of Alexandrium in   field samples and in experiments significantly altered the relative   abundances of bacterial and phytoplankton by both suppressing and   promoting different taxa, while this effect was weaker in Dinophysis.   Experiments specifically revealed a negative feedback loop during blooms   whereby Alexandrium filtrate promoted the abundance of the parasite,   Amoebophrya spp. Collectively, this study demonstrates that HABs formed   by Alexandrium and Dinophysis harbor unique prokaryotic and eukaryotic   microbiomes that are likely to, in turn, influence the dynamics of these   HABs.

Insight into the cutaneous microbiome in HS using   next-generation sequencing may provide novel data on the microbiological   diversity of the skin.   OBJECTIVE To investigate the follicular skin microbiome in patients with   HS and in healthy controls.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case-control study obtained punch   biopsy specimens from patients with HS (lesional and nonlesional) and   healthy controls between October 1, 2014, and August 1, 2016. Data were   analyzed from March to November 2016. Patients with HS were recruited   from the Department of Dermatology, Zealand University Hospital,   Roskilde, Denmark. Biopsy specimens were analyzed at the Department of   Microbiology and Infection Control, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen,   Denmark. None of the participants received any antibiotics (systemic or   topical therapy) within 1 month before the study. In patients with HS,   biopsy specimens were obtained from lesional skin (axilla or groin) and   nonlesional skin. Only nodules containing at least 1 visible hair   follicle were biopsied. Biopsy specimens from healthy controls were   obtained from the axilla only.   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The different microbiomes were investigated   using next-generation sequencing targeting 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA.   RESULTS The skin microbiome was characterized in 30 patients with HS   (mean [SD] age, 46.9 [14.0] years; 19 [63\% female]) and 24   healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 32.2 [12.0] years; 13 [54\%   female]). The next-generation sequencing data provided a previously   unreported (to our knowledge) characterization of the skin microbiome in   HS. The study demonstrated that the microbiome in HS differs   significantly from that in healthy controls in lesional and nonlesional   skin. Overall, the following 5 microbiome types were identified:   Corynebacterium species (type I), Acinetobacter and Moraxella species   (type II), Staphylococcus epidermidis (type III), Porphyromonas and   Peptoniphilus species (type IV), and Propionibacterium acnes (type V).   In lesional skin, microbiome types consisted predominantly of type I or   type IV. Microbiome type IV was not detected in healthy controls.   Several taxa, including Propionibacterium, showed a significantly higher   relative abundance in healthy controls vs HS skin, indicating that   Propionibacterium may be part of the pathogenesis in HS.   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The study findings suggest a link between a   dysbiotic cutaneous microbiome and HS."

In contrast to the adult gut   mycobiota, the establishment of the early gut mycobiota has never been   described, and there is little knowledge about the fungal transfer from   mother to offspring.   Methods: In a prospective cohort, we followed 298 pairs of healthy   mothers and offspring from 36 weeks of gestation until 2 years of age   (1516 samples) and explored the gut mycobiota in maternal and offspring   samples. Half of the pregnant mothers were randomised into drinking   probiotic milk during and after pregnancy. The probiotic bacteria   included Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Bifidobacterium animalis   subsp. lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. We quantified   the fungal abundance of all the samples using qPCR of the fungal   internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 segment, and we sequenced the 18S   rRNA gene ITS1 region of 90 high-quantity samples using the MiSeq   platform (Illumina).   Results: The gut mycobiota was detected in most of the mothers and the   majority of the offspring. The offspring showed increased odds of having   detectable faecal fungal DNA if the mother had detectable fungal DNA as   well (OR = 1.54, p = 0.04). The fungal alpha diversity in the offspring   gut increased from its lowest at 10 days after birth, which was the   earliest sampling point. The fungal diversity and fungal species showed   a succession towards the maternal mycobiota as the child aged, with   Debaryomyces hansenii being the most abundant species during   breast-feeding and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the most abundant after   weaning. Probiotic consumption increased the gut mycobiota abundance in   pregnant mothers (p = 0.01).   Conclusion: This study provides the first insight into the early fungal   establishment and the succession of fungal species in the gut mycobiota.   The results support the idea that the fungal host phenotype is   transferred from mother to offspring."

Here, we performed an integrated meta-omic analysis to probe deeper into   the GIT microbiome changes during allo-HSCT and its accompanying   treatments. We used 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to resolve   archaea, bacteria,and eukaryotes within the GIT microbiomes of 16   patients undergoing allo-HSCT for the treatment of hematologic   malignancies. These results revealed a major shift in the GIT microbiome   after allo-HSCT including a marked reduction in bacterial diversity,   accompanied by only limited changes in eukaryotes and archaea.

This patient developed severe GvHD, leading   to death 9 months after allo-HSCT. In addition to drastically decreased   bacterial diversity, the Post-treatment microbiome showed a higher   overall number and higher expression levels of antibiotic resistance   genes (ARGs). One specific Escherichia coil strain causing a   paravertebral abscess was linked to GIT dysbiosis, suggesting loss of   intestinal barrier integrity. The apparent selection for bacteria   expressing ARGs suggests that prophylactic antibiotic administration may   adversely affect the overall treatment outcome. We therefore assert that   such analyses including information about the selection of pathogenic   bacteria expressing ARGs may assist clinicians in ``personalizing''   regimens for individual patients to improve overall outcomes."

For   example, its leaf surface microbiome could inhibit or attract eukaryotic   epibionts which may overgrow the eelgrass leading to reduced primary   productivity and subsequent eelgrass meadow decline. We used amplicon   sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes   to assess the leaf surface microbiome (prokaryotes) as well as   eukaryotic epibionts in-and outside lagoons on the German Baltic Sea   coast. Prokaryote microbiomes varied substantially both between sites   inside lagoons and between open coastal and lagoon sites. Water depth,   leaf area and biofilm chlorophyll a concentration explained a large   amount of variation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic community   composition. The prokaryotic microbiome and eukaryotic epibiont   communities were highly correlated, and network analysis revealed   disproportionate co-occurrence between a limited number of eukaryotic   taxa and several bacterial taxa. This suggests that eelgrass leaf   surfaces are home to a mosaic of microbiomes of several epibiotic   eukaryotes, in addition to the microbiome of the eelgrass itself. Our   findings thereby underline that eukaryotic diversity should be taken   into account in order to explain prokaryotic microbiome assembly and   dynamics in aquatic environments."

As high species diversity   is an index of ecosystem health, the intestinal biome of healthier,   socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of   subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth   predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults. We   tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age (juvenile/adult) and   (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome   diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a   highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status   determines access to resources.

We compared sequence abundances to   classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa   detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads   significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted,   underscoring the value of an amplicon sequencing approach for   quantitative measurements of parasite load.

Shifts in prokaryotic   succession in CSD infants compared to vaginally delivered (VD) infants   were apparent as early as days 3 and 5, which were characterized by   increased relative abundances of the genera Streptococcus and   Staphylococcus, and a decrease in relative abundance for the genera   Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. Generally, a depletion in Bacteroidetes   was detected as early as day 5 postpartum in CSD infants, causing a   significantly increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio between days 5   and 150 when compared to VD infants. Although the delivery mode appeared   to have the strongest influence on differences between the infants,   other factors such as a younger gestational age or maternal antibiotics   intake likely contributed to the observed patterns as well.

Barley, oat and triticale forages as well as an intercropped mixture of   the 3 crops were harvested and ensiled in mini silos for a period of 90   days, followed by 14 days of aerobic exposure. Changes in fermentation   characteristics and nutritive value were assessed in terminal silages   and bacterial and fungal communities during ensiling and aerobic   exposure were described using 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing, respectively.   Results: All small grain silages exhibited chemical traits that were   associated with well ensiled forages, such as low pH value (4.09 +/-   0.28) and high levels of lactic acid (59.8 +/- 14.59 mg/g DM). The   number of microbial core genome operational taxonomic units (OTUs)   decreased with time of ensiling. Taxonomic bacterial community profiles   were dominated by the Lactobacillales after fermentation, with a notable   increase in Bacillales as a result of aerobic exposure. Diversity of the   fungal core microbiome was shown to also be reduced during ensiling.   Operational taxonomic units assigned to filamentous fungi were found in   the core microbiome at ensiling and after aerobic exposure, whereas the   Saccharomycetales were the dominate yeast population after 90 days of   ensiling and aerobic exposure. Bacterial and fungal orders typically   associated with silage spoilage were identified in the core microbiome   after aerobic exposure.   Conclusion: Next Generation Sequencing was successfully used to describe   bacterial communities and the first record of fungal communities   throughout the process of ensiling and utilization. Adequately   describing the microbial ecology of silages could lead to improved   ensiling practices and the selection of silage inoculants that act   synergistically with the natural forage microbiome."

Our goal was to describe the   biodiversity and biogeography of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic   microbes in an urban setting while assessing the potential source of   microbial assemblages on ATM keypads. Microbial swab samples were   collected from three boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) during   June and July 2014, followed by generation of Illumina MiSeq datasets   for bacterial (16S rRNA) and eukaryotic (18S rRNA) marker genes.   Downstream analysis was carried out in the QIIME pipeline, in   conjunction with neighborhood metadata (ethnicity, population, age   groups) from the NYC Open Data portal. Neither the 16S nor 18S rRNA   datasets showed any clustering patterns related to geography or   neighborhood demographics. Bacterial assemblages on ATM keypads were   dominated by taxonomic groups known to be associated with human skin   communities (Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and   Proteobacteria), although SourceTracker analysis was unable to identify   the source habitat for the majority of taxa. Eukaryotic assemblages were   dominated by fungal taxa as well as by a low-diversity protist community   containing both free-living and potentially pathogenic taxa (Toxoplasma,   Trichomonas). Our results suggest that ATM keypads amalgamate microbial   assemblages from different sources, including the human microbiome,   eukaryotic food species, and potentially novel extremophilic taxa   adapted to air or surfaces in the built environment. DNA obtained from   ATM keypads may thus provide a record of both human behavior and   environmental sources of microbes.   IMPORTANCE Automated teller machine (ATM) keypads represent a specific   and unexplored microhabitat for microbial communities. Although the   number of built environment and urban microbial ecology studies has   expanded greatly in recent years, the majority of research to date has   focused on mass transit systems, city soils, and plumbing and   ventilation systems in buildings. ATM surfaces, potentially retaining   microbial signatures of human inhabitants, including both commensal taxa   and pathogens, are interesting from both a biodiversity perspective and   a public health perspective. By focusing on ATM keypads in different   geographic areas of New York City with distinct population demographics,   we aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of both   prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, thus making a unique contribution   to the growing body of work focused on the ``urban microbiome.'' In   New York City, the surface area of urban surfaces in Manhattan far   exceeds the geographic area of the island itself. We have only just   begun to describe the vast array of microbial taxa that are likely to be   present across diverse types of urban habitats."

For a more   holistic understanding of a microbiome, a strategy to characterize the   viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic components is necessary.   Results: We developed a method for metagenomic and amplicon-based   analysis of freshwater samples involving the concentration and   size-based separation of eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral fractions.   Next-generation sequencing and culture-independent approaches were used   to describe and quantify microbial communities in watersheds with   different land use in British Columbia. Deep amplicon sequencing was   used to investigate the distribution of certain viruses (g23 and RdRp),   bacteria (16S rRNA and cpn60), and eukaryotes (18S rRNA and ITS).   Metagenomic sequencing was used to further characterize the gene content   of the bacterial and viral fractions at both taxonomic and functional   levels.

Mechanical drainage is a widely used agricultural   practice which allows for the management of surface and sub-surface   water. It is vital for improving land productivity and reclaiming   marginal land. The use of mechanical drainage is known to have several   impacts on the physico-chemical components of soil; however, little is   known about its effect on the soil microbiome. In the present study, 454   pyrosequencing of the 18S and 16S rRNA gene regions was used to evaluate   differences in fungal and bacterial communities in soil samples taken   pre and two months post drainage from an extensively managed grassland   in Co., Meath, Ireland.   Mechanical drainage was found to have no significant impact on soil pH   or on soil carbon and nitrogen levels, however a statistically   significant reduction in moisture content was recorded (c. 7\%).   Analysis of metagenetic data showed that Basidiomycota was the largest   classifiable fungal phylum accounting for 16\% of all sequences. The   predominant bacterial phyla identified in all samples were   Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria with average relative   abundances of 23\%, 26\% and 27\% respectively. Overall fungal and   bacterial community structure and diversity remained unchanged in   response to mechanical drainage but two fungal phyla, Chytridiomycota   and Blastocladiomycota, showed a significant increase in relative   abundance in response to drainage. These findings contribute to our   overall understanding of how mechanical drainage impacts the soil   microbiome. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

They carry different types of RNA   species, and reported profile discrepancies related to the   presence/absence of 18s and 28s rRNA remain controversial. Moreover,   sufficient urinary RNA yields and respective quality RNA profiles are   still to be fully established.   Methods: UEVs were enriched by hydrostatic filtration dialysis, and RNA   content was extracted using 7 different commercially available   techniques. RNA quantity was assessed using spectrophotometry and   fluorometry, whilst RNA quality was determined by capillary   electrophoresis.   Results: The presence of prokaryotic transcriptome was stressed when   cellular RNA, as a control, was spiked into the UEVs samples before RNA   extraction. The presence of bacteria in hydrostatic filtration dialysis   above 1,000 kDa molecular weight cut-off and in crude urine was   confirmed with growth media plates. The efficiency in removing urinary   bacteria was evaluated by differential centrifugation, filtration (0.22   mu m filters) and chemical pretreatment (water purification tablet). For   volumes of urine >200 ml, the chemical treatment provides ease of   handling without affecting vesicle integrity, protein and RNA profiles.   This protocol was selected to enrich RNA with 7 methods, and its   respective quality and quantity were assessed. The results were given as   follows: (a) Fluorometry gave more repeatability and reproducibility   than spectrophotometry to assess the RNA yields, (b) UEVs were enriched   with small RNA, (c) Ribosomal RNA peaks were not observed for any RNA   extraction method used and (d) RNA yield was higher for column-based   method designed for urinary exosome, whilst the highest relative   microRNA presence was obtained using TRIzol method.   Conclusion: Our results show that the presence of bacteria can lead to   misidentification in the electrophoresis peaks. Fluorometry is more   reliable than spectrophotometry. RNA isolation method must be selected   in conjunction with appropriate UEV collection procedure. We also   suggested that a minimum 250 ml of urine should be processed to gather   enough RNA for robust quantification, qualification and downstream   analysis."

Epidemiological studies   often rely on broad biomarkers of microbial exposure (i.e. endotoxin, 1   -> 3-beta-D-glucan), but fail to identify the taxonomic composition of   the microbial community. Our aim was to characterize the bacterial and   fungal microbiome in different types of environmental samples collected   in studies of human health effects. We determined the composition of   microbial communities present in home, school and outdoor air samples by   amplifying and sequencing regions of rRNA genes from bacteria (16S) and   fungi (18S and ITS). Samples for this pilot study included indoor   settled dust (from both a Boston area birth cohort study on Home   Allergens and Asthma (HAA) (n = 12) and a study of school exposures and   asthma symptoms (SICAS) (n = 1)), as well as fine and coarse   concentrated outdoor ambient particulate (CAP) samples (n = 9).   Sequencing of amplified 16S, 18S, and ITS regions was performed on the   Roche-454 Life Sciences Titanium pyrosequencing platform. Indoor dust   samples were dominated by Gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes and   Actinobacteria); the most abundant bacterial genera were those related   to human flora (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and   Lactobacillus). Outdoor CAPs were dominated by Gram-negative   Proteobacteria from water and soil sources, in particular the genera   Acidovorax, and Brevundimonas (which were present at very low levels or   entirely absent in indoor dust). Phylum-level fungal distributions   identified by 18S or ITS regions showed very similar findings: a   predominance of Ascomycota in indoor dust and Basidiomycota in outdoor   CAPs. ITS sequencing of fungal genera in indoor dust showed significant   proportions of Aureobasidium and Leptosphaerulina along with some   contribution from Cryptococcus, Epicoccum, Aspergillus and the human   commensal Malassezia. ITS sequencing detected more than 70 fungal genera   in indoor dust not observed by culture. Microbiome sequencing is   feasible for different types of archived environmental samples (indoor   dust, and low biomass air particulate samples), and offers the potential   to study how whole communities of microbes (including unculturable taxa)   influence human health."

Objectives: To characterize the mycobiome at different respiratory tract   levels in persons with and without HIV infection and in HIV-infected   individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).   Methods: Oral washes (OW), induced sputa (IS), and bronchoalveolar   lavages (BAL) were collected from 56 participants. We performed 18S and   internal transcribed spacer sequencing and used the neutral model to   identify fungal species that are likely residents of the lung. We used   ubiquity ubiquity plots, random forest, logistic regression, and   metastats to compare fungal communities by HIV status and presence of   COPD.   Measurements and Main Results: Mycobiomes of OW, IS, and BAL shared   common organisms, but each also had distinct members. Candida was   dominant in OW and IS, but BAL had 39 fungal species that were   disproportionately more abundant than in the OW. Fungal communities in   BAL differed significantly by HIV status and by COPD, with Pneumocystis   jirovecii significantly overrepresented in both groups. Other fungal   species were also identified as differing in HIV and COPD.   Conclusions: This study systematically examined the respiratory tract   mycobiome in a relatively large group. By identifying Pneumocystis and   other fungal species as overrepresented in the lung in HIV and in COPD,   it is the first to determine alterations in fungal communities   associated with lung dysfunction and/or HIV, highlighting the clinical   relevance of these findings."

The prepartum and postpartum diets of high-producing dairy cows   are substantially different, but in what ways the rumen microbiome   changes in response and how those changes may influence production   traits are not well elucidated. Here, we sequenced the 16S and 18S rRNA   genes using the MiSeq platform to characterize the prepartum and   postpartum rumen fluid microbiomes in 115 high-producing dairy cows,   including both primiparous and multiparous animals. Discriminant   analysis identified differences between the microbiomes of prepartum and   postpartum samples and between primiparous and multiparous cows. 18S   rRNA sequencing revealed an overwhelming dominance of the protozoan   class Litostomatea, with over 90\% of the eukaryotic microbial   population belonging to that group. Additionally, fungi were relatively   more prevalent and Litostomatea relatively less prevalent in prepartum   samples than in postpartum ones. The core rumen microbiome (common to   all samples) consisted of 64 bacterial taxa, of which members of the   genus Prevotella were the most prevalent. The Chao1 richness index was   greater for prepartum multiparous cows than for postpartum multiparous   cows. Multivariable models identified bacterial taxa associated with   increased or reduced milk production, and general linear models revealed   that a metagenomically based prediction of productivity is highly   associated with production of actual milk and milk components. In   conclusion, the structure of the rumen fluid microbiome shifts between   the prepartum and first-week postpartum periods, and its profile within   the context of this study could be used to accurately predict production   traits."

The disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often involves chronic   airway colonization by bacteria and fungi, and these infections cause   irreversible lung damage. Fungi are detected more frequently in CF   sputum samples upon initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and several   studies have implicated the detection of fungi in sputum with worse   outcomes. Thus, a more complete understanding of fungi in CF is   required.   Results: We characterized the fungi and bacteria in expectorated sputa   from six CF subjects. Samples were collected upon admission for systemic   antibacterial therapy and upon the completion of treatment and analyzed   using a pyrosequencing-based analysis of fungal internal transcribed   spacer 1 (ITS1) and bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. A mixture of Candida   species and Malassezia dominated the mycobiome in all samples (74\%-99\%   of fungal reads). There was not a striking trend correlating fungal and   bacterial richness, and richness showed a decline after antibiotic   therapy particularly for the bacteria. The fungal communities within a   sputum sample resembled other samples from that subject despite the   aggressive antibacterial therapy. Quantitative PCR analysis of fungal   18S rDNA sequences to assess fungal burden showed variation in fungal   density in sputum before and after antibacterial therapy but no   consistent directional trend. Analysis of Candida ITS1 sequences   amplified from sputum or pure culture-derived genomic DNA from   individual Candida species found little (<0.5\%) or no variation in ITS1   sequences within or between strains, thereby validating this locus for   the purpose of Candida species identification. We also report the   enhancement of the publically available Visualization and Analysis of   Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) tool for the analysis of fungal   communities in clinical samples.   Conclusions: Fungi are present in CF respiratory sputum. In CF, the use   of intravenous antibiotic therapy often does not profoundly impact   bacterial community structure, and we observed a similar stability in   fungal species composition. Further studies are required to predict the   effects of antibacterials on fungal burden in CF and fungal community   stability in non-CF populations."

Next-generation sequencing approaches can overcome the   bottleneck of individual specimen isolation and identification by   simultaneously sequencing specimens of all taxa in a bulk mixture. Here   we apply multiple parallel amplification primers, multiple DNA barcode   markers, 454-pyrosequencing, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing to the same   sample to maximize recovery of the arthropod macrobiome and the   bacterial and other microbial microbiome of a bulk arthropod sample. We   validate this method with a complex sample containing 1,066   morphologically distinguishable arthropods from a tropical terrestrial   ecosystem with high taxonomic diversity. Multiamplicon next-generation   DNA barcoding was able to recover sequences corresponding to 91\% of the   distinguishable individuals in a bulk environmental sample, as well as   many species present as undistinguishable tissue. 454-pyrosequencing was   able to recover 10 more families of arthropods and 30 more species than   did conventional Sanger sequencing of each individual specimen. The use   of other loci (16S and 18S ribosomal DNA gene regions) also added the   detection of species of microbes associated with these terrestrial   arthropods. This method greatly decreases the time and money necessary   to perform DNA-based comparisons of biodiversity among ecosystem   samples. This methodology opens the door to much cheaper and increased   capacity for ecological and evolutionary studies applicable to a wide   range of socio-economic issues, as well as a basic understanding of how   the world works."

This study examines   the fungal component of the microbiome in CRS patients and controls   using a highly sensitive culture-independent molecular technique. The   aims of this study include the characterization of fungal richness,   prevalence, abundance, temporal changes, and their relationship with   patient outcomes.   Methods   Swabs were collected from the sinuses of 23 CRS patients and 11   controls. Collection occurred intraoperatively, and at 6 and 12 weeks   postoperatively. DNA was extracted from the swabs and fungal outcomes   were determined through 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fungal tag-encoded FLX   amplicon pyrosequencing.   Results   Fungi were ubiquitous to all patients. A total of 207 fungal genera were   detected, with a mean sample richness of 8.18 and 12.14 in the control   and CRS groups, respectively. Malassezia was detected in all patients at   surgery and was also the most abundant. Postoperatively, fungal richness   decreased (p < 0.05) and was associated with declines in the prevalence   of Fusarium and Neocosmospora (p < 0.05). Neocosmospora was also less   abundant postoperatively (p < 0.05). No correlations were found with   quality of life.   Conclusion   This is the first study to use a highly sensitive pyrosequencing   technique to reveal the true diversity of fungi in the sinuses of CRS   patients and postoperative changes in richness. The presence of   Malassezia, a genus not previously described in the sinuses, is of great   interest, and its potential as a disease modifier should see further   investigation given its association with atopic disease."

The etiology of   CRS is not well understood.   OBJECTIVE To obtain insights into the disease process, we contrasted the   microbiome and immune response from patients with CRS and healthy   controls.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A case vs control design was used.   Samples were collected in the operating room in an institutional   hospital or clinic. Thirty patients with CRS and 12 healthy controls   undergoing surgery were recruited.   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The microbiome was analyzed by deep   sequencing of the bacterial 16S and fungal 18S ribosomal RNA genes.   Immune response was measured by quantification of 30 different cytokines   by multiplexed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immune cells in   the lavage were identified by flow cytometry. The immune response of   peripheral blood leukocytes to the lavage microbiota was assessed by   interleukin (IL)-5 enzyme-linked immunospot assay.   RESULTS While quantitative increase in most bacterial and fungal species   was observed in patients with CRS relative to controls, the microbiomes   of patients with CRS were qualitatively similar to the controls. Because   these results indicated that bacteria and fungi are not triggering CRS,   we undertook a more detailed characterization of the immune response.   Patients with CRS had increased levels of the following cytokines: IL-4,   IL-5, IL-8, and IL-13, along with increased levels of eosinophils and   basophils in the lavage. Importantly, peripheral blood leukocytes   isolated from patients with CRS responded to control lavage samples (ie,   to commensals) to produce IL-5. In contrast, the same lavage sample   evoked no IL-5 production in leukocytes from healthy controls.   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings support the theory that in some   cases CRS results from an immune hyperresponsiveness to commensal   organisms."

Most bacteria are   digested rapidly by phagocytosis, however some are able to survive   within amoebae and some are even able to multiply, as it is the case for   Legionella pneumophila. These resisting bacteria are a potential health   problem as they could also resist to macrophage phagocytosis. Several   publications already reported intra-amoebal bacteria but the methods of   identification did not allow metagenomic analysis and are partly based   on co-culture with one selected amoebal strain. The aim of our study was   to conduct a rRNA-targeted metagenomic analysis on amoebae and   intra-amoebal bacteria found in drinking water network, to provide the   first FLA microbiome in environmental strains. Three sites of a water   network were sampled during four months. Culturable FLA were isolated   and total DNA was prepared, allowing purification of both amoebal and   bacterial DNA. Metagenomic studies were then conducted through 18S or   16S amplicons sequencing. Hartmannella was by far the most represented   genus of FLA. Regarding intra-amoebal bacteria, 54 genera were   identified, among which 21 were newly described intra-amoebal bacteria,   underlying the power of our approach. There were high differences in   bacterial diversity between the three sites. Several genera were highly   represented and/or found at least in two sites, underlying that these   bacteria could be able to multiply within FLA. Our method is therefore   useful to identify FLA microbiome and could be applied to other networks   to have a more comprehensive view of intra-amoebal diversity. (C) 2013   Elsevier Ltd.

An important   data gap however, that remains poorly studied is the baseline   description of microflora that may be associated with plant anatomy   either endemically or in response to environmental pressures. Specific   anatomical niches of plants may contribute to persistence of human   pathogens in agricultural environments in ways we have yet to describe.   Tomatoes have been implicated in outbreaks of Salmonella at least 17   times during the years spanning 1990 to 2010. Our research seeks to   provide a baseline description of the tomato microbiome and possibly   identify whether or not there is something distinctive about tomatoes or   their growing ecology that contributes to persistence of Salmonella in   this important food crop.   Results: DNA was recovered from washes of epiphytic surfaces of tomato   anatomical organs; leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits of Solanum   lycopersicum (BHN602), grown at a site in close proximity to commercial   farms previously implicated in tomato-Salmonella outbreaks. DNA was   amplified for targeted 16S and 18S rRNA genes and sheared for shotgun   metagenomic sequencing. Amplicons and metagenomes were used to describe   ``native'' bacterial microflora for diverse anatomical parts of   Virginia-grown tomatoes.   Conclusions: Distinct groupings of microbial communities were associated   with different tomato plant organs and a gradient of compositional   similarity could be correlated to the distance of a given plant part   from the soil. Unique bacterial phylotypes (at 95\% identity) were   associated with fruits and flowers of tomato plants. These include   Microvirga, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Brachybacterium, Rhizobiales,   Paracocccus, Chryseomonas and Microbacterium. The most frequently   observed bacterial taxa across aerial plant regions were Pseudomonas and   Xanthomonas. Dominant fungal taxa that could be identified to genus with   18S amplicons included Hypocrea, Aureobasidium and Cryptococcus. No   definitive presence of Salmonella could be confirmed in any of the plant   samples, although 16S sequences suggested that closely related genera   were present on leaves, fruits and roots."

Sea ice is a distinct habitat and   the morphologically identifiable sympagic community living within sea   ice can be readily distinguished from pelagic species. Sympagic metazoa   and diatoms have been studied extensively since they can be identified   using microscopy techniques. However, non-diatom eukaryotic cells living   in ice have received much less attention despite taxa such as the   dinoflagellate Polarella and the cercozoan Cryothecomonas being isolated   from sea ice. Other small flagellates have also been reported,   suggesting complex microbial food webs. Since smaller flagellates are   fragile, often poorly preserved, and are difficult for non-experts to   identify, we applied high throughput tag sequencing of the V4 region of   the 18S rRNA gene to investigate the eukaryotic microbiome within the   ice. The sea ice communities were diverse (190 taxa) and included many   heterotrophic and mixotrophic species. Dinoflagellates (43 taxa),   diatoms (29 taxa) and cercozoans (12 taxa) accounted for similar to 80\%   of the sequences. The sympagic communities living within drift ice and   land-fast ice harbored taxonomically distinct communities and we   highlight specific taxa of dinoflagellates and diatoms that may be   indicators of land-fast and drift ice."

The accuracy of these analyses depends strongly on the choice   of primers. The overall coverage and phylum spectrum of 175 primers and   512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect to the SILVA   16S/18S rDNA non-redundant reference dataset (SSURef 108 NR). Based on   this evaluation a selection of `best available' primer pairs for   Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000,   epsilon 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair   (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of   464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic   distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from   directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as   a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage   and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the   bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies."

Through the use of 16S rRNA gene dendrograms, the caecum   microbiome was shown to cluster separately from the other gut regions.   16S rRNA gene-based quantitative PCR (q-PCR) also demonstrated   differences between the caecum and the other gut regions. Metabolites as   identified by Fourier transform infrared clustered in a similar way and   specific metabolic products (volatile fatty acids and ammonia) also   varied by region. Protozoal 18S rDNA concentration and archaeal mcrA   gene concentration quantified by q-PCR were found in higher numbers in   the colon than the other gut regions. Diversity calculations using   Simpson and ShannonWiener indices demonstrated higher diversity in the   right dorsal colon and faeces than in the caecum. All findings of this   study suggest that faecal samples are likely to represent the microbial   population of the right dorsal colon to some extent but not that of the   caecum, indicating careful consideration is required when planning   microbial investigations of the hindgut of the horse."

Limitation of current approaches for quantifying the   fungal component in the human microbiome suggests the need for new   broad-coverage techniques.   Methods: We analyzed 2,085 18S rRNA gene sequences from the SILVA   database for assay design. We generated and quantified plasmid standards   using a qPCR-based approach. We evaluated assay coverage against 4,968   sequences and performed assay validation following the Minimum   Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments   (MIQE) guidelines.   Results: We designed FungiQuant, a TaqMan (R) qPCR assay targeting a 351   bp region in the fungal 18S rRNA gene. Our in silico analysis showed   that FungiQuant is a perfect sequence match to 90.0\% of the 2,617   fungal species analyzed. We showed that FungiQuant's is 100\% sensitive   and its amplification efficiencies ranged from 76.3\% to 114.5\%, with   r(2)-values of >0.99 against the 69 fungal species tested. Additionally,   FungiQuant inter-and intra-run coefficients of variance ranged from   <10\% and <20\%, respectively. We further showed that FungiQuant has a   limit of quantification 25 copies and a limit of detection at 5 copies.   Lastly, by comparing results from human-only background DNA with   low-level fungal DNA, we showed that amplification in two or three of a   FungiQuant performed in triplicate is statistically significant for true   positive fungal detection.   Conclusions: FungiQuant has comprehensive coverage against diverse fungi   and is a robust quantification and detection tool for delineating   between true fungal detection and non-target human DNA."

The diversity of eukaryotes inhabiting humans remains   relatively unexplored because of either the low abundance of these   organisms in human gut or because they have received limited attention   from a whole-community perspective.   Methodology/Principal Finding: In this study, a single fecal sample from   a healthy African male was studied using both culture-dependent methods   and extended molecular methods targeting the 18S rRNA and ITS sequences.   Our results revealed that very few fungi, including Candida spp.,   Galactomyces spp., and Trichosporon asahii, could be isolated using   culture-based methods. In contrast, a relatively a high number of   eukaryotic species could be identified in this fecal sample when   culture-independent methods based on various primer sets were used. A   total of 27 species from one sample were found among the 977 analyzed   clones. The clone libraries were dominated by fungi (716 clones/977,   73.3\%), corresponding to 16 different species. In addition, 187   sequences out of 977 (19.2\%) corresponded to 9 different species of   plants; 59 sequences (6\%) belonged to other micro-eukaryotes in the   gut, including Entamoeba hartmanni and Blastocystis sp; and only 15   clones/977 (1.5\%) were related to human 18S rRNA sequences.   Conclusion: Our results revealed a complex eukaryotic community in the   volunteer's gut, with fungi being the most abundant species in the stool   sample. Larger investigations are needed to assess the generality of   these results and to understand their roles in human health and disease."

Mean population densities   (numbers per gram wet weight) of methanogenic archaea, rumen bacteria   and ciliate protozoa, estimated using quantitative real-time polymerase   chain reaction (PCR), were 3.17 x 10(9), 5.17 x 10(11) and 4.02 x 10(7),   respectively. Molecular diversity of rumen methanogens was revealed   using a 16S rRNA gene library (54 clones) constructed using pooled PCR   products from the whole rumen contents of the five individual reindeer.   Based upon a similarity criterion of < 97\%, a total of 19 distinct   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, nine of which are   potential new species. The 16S rRNA sequences generated from the   reindeer rumen exhibited a high degree of sequence similarity to   methanogens affiliated with the families Methanobacteriaceae (14 OTUs)   and Methanosarcinaceae (one OTU). Four of the OTUs detected belonged to   a group of uncultivated archaea previously found in domestic ruminants   and thought to be dominant in the rumen together with Methanobrevibacter   spp. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of the rumen   bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the protozoal 18S rRNA gene indicated a high   degree of animal variation, although some bands were common to all   individuals. Automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA)   profiling of the ruminal Neocallimastigales population indicated that   the reindeer are likely to contain more than one type of anaerobic   fungus. The ARISA profile from one animal was distinct from the other   four. This is the first molecular investigation of the ruminal   methanogenic archaea in reindeer, revealing higher numbers than expected   based on methane emission data available. Also, many of the reindeer   archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were similar to those reported in   domesticated ruminants in Australia, Canada, China, New Zealand and   Venezuela, supporting previous findings that there seems to be no host   type or geographical effect on the methanogenic archaea community   structure in ruminants."
